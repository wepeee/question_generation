The balanced equation is 2 Al + 3 H2SO4 -> 3 H2 + Al2(SO4)3. Using stoichiometry, if we have 'x' moles of Al, it will produce x/2 moles of SOHCl3 (using an assumed coefficient for simplicity).

chemistry,phi,struktur2,30,16437,A solution containing aqueous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) is prepared by mixing 0.75 mol of KOH with enough water to make 1 liter of solution.,A: The concentration of OH- in the mixture is higher than H+,B: Copper(II) nitrate will precipitate from this solution,C: Potassium sulfate and copper hydroxide are formed when KOH reacts with CuSO4·5H2O,D: The pH of the mixture is neutral,C,"The reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate produces a precipitate, which involves exchanging ions. KOH provides OH- to the solution while CuSO4·5H2O contains water molecules bound within its structure that will interact with K+ as well. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: KOH + CuSO4·5H2O → K2SO4 + Cu(OH)2↓ (s) Here, copper hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] precipitates out of the solution. Potassium sulfate remains dissolved in water. To find out which answer is correct: a) The concentration of OH- will indeed be higher than H+ because KOH dissociates into K+ and OH- ions, but this does not directly lead to a precipitation reaction between these compounds. Hence option A might seem plausible at first glance. b) Copper(II) nitrate formation implies the presence of NO3-, which is incorrect as we only have CuSO4·5H2O and KOH in our reactants, so B is wrong, c) The precipitation reaction between copper ions from CuSO4·5H2O with hydroxide ions provides us with option C. Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate contains water molecules coordinated to the copper ion; these will not form a new compound as implied in D but rather, contribute to maintaining hydration around the Cu^2+. d) The pH of the mixture is acidic due to the presence of OH- ions from KOH dissociating and reacting with H+ present (water itself has very little free protons), so option D contradicts this fact, which means it's incorrect as well. Therefore, C stands correct because potassium sulfate is water-soluble while copper hydroxide precipitates.","The reaction between aqueous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a double displacement reaction. The balanced chemical equation is 2KOH(aq) + CuSO4(aq) -> Cu(OH)2(s) + K2SO4(aq). The products are copper(II) hydroxide, which is an insoluble solid precipitate, and potassium sulfate, which is a soluble salt. Option C correctly identifies these products. Option B is incorrect as no nitrate ions are present. Options A and D concern the final pH, which cannot be definitively determined without knowing the amount of CuSO4 used, making C the most certain and correct statement.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,27311,2,5,Correct,1.5,"Clarity: The question is poorly worded. It is unclear how the CuSO4 is mixed and, crucially, the amount of CuSO4 is not specified. This ambiguity makes it impossible to definitively evaluate options A and D, which depend on the final stoichiometry.
Context Accuracy: The chemical context is perfectly valid. The reaction between copper(II) sulfate and potassium hydroxide is a standard precipitation reaction used in introductory chemistry. The substances and concentrations are realistic.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is deeply flawed. It provides an unbalanced chemical equation. Most significantly, its explanation for option D is fundamentally incorrect, stating that OH- ions make a solution acidic. The reasoning for option A is also weak.

It is unclear whether the 159.607 g refers to the initial hydrate or the final anhydrous product.

Context Accuracy: The underlying chemical concept (dehydration of a salt hydrate) and the given molar mass for anhydrous CuCl2 are correct. The only minor omission is not specifying which hydrate is being used (e.g., the common dihydrate, CuCl2·2H2O), though this information is not strictly needed to find the moles of the product.

The balanced equation is 2 Al + 3 H2SO4 -> 3 H2 + Al2(SO4)3. Using stoichiometry, if we have 'x' moles of Al, it will produce x/2 moles of SOHCl3 (using an assumed coefficient for simplicity). So the correct option is A where 0.5 mol Al produces 1 mole H2.","First, write and balance the chemical equation for the reaction of aluminum (Al) with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).
