The stoichiometry requires 1 mole of H2SO4 to react with 1 mole of CaCO3, and the given volumes contain 0.07 moles of each reactant. After the reaction, there is excess H2SO4, which will not affect the pH significantly. The initial pH is calculated as pH = -log[H+], where [H+] is estimated from the amount of H2SO4 left over.

Moles CaCO3 = 1.8 mol/L * 0.0100 L = 0.018 mol. The stoichiometry is 1:1, so CaCO3 is the limiting reactant. The moles of excess H2SO4 are 0.070 mol - 0.018 mol = 0.052 mol.

Given [CaCO3] = 0.15 M, we can calculate the concentration of H+ ions to be very low, making the pH ≈ pOH (pOH ≈ -log[OH-]) = 8.4.","The question is flawed as a 0.15 M solution of CaCO3 is impossible due to its low solubility (Ksp ≈ 4.5 x 10⁻⁹, molar solubility ≈ 6.7 x 10⁻⁵ M). 
Assuming a hypothetical 0.15 M solution of the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻), its hydrolysis must be considered: CO₃²⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HCO₃⁻ + OH⁻.
The Kb for CO₃²⁻ is Kw / Ka(HCO₃⁻) ≈ (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (4.7 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 2.13 x 10⁻⁴.
Setting up an ICE table: Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CO₃²⁻] ≈ x² / 0.15.

chemistry,llama,struktur2,11,11429,A mixture of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) is prepared by slowly adding 25 mL of a 0.100 M KOH solution to 35.5 g of H2C2O4.

The amount of KOH added is determined by its molarity, whereas the amount of H2C2O4 is determined by its mass.

The ratio of [CH3COOH] to [NaOH] is 1:2, which means the pH will initially be around 4.5. As more NaOH dissolves, the pH will eventually increase as the excess acid is neutralized.","First, calculate the initial moles of the reactants. Moles of NaOH = 2.00 g / 40.00 g/mol = 0.0500 mol.

What is the molarity of the NaOH?",0.5,1.2,3.75,5.6,D,"The initial pH is not given, but it's assumed to be very high due to the strong base. The addition of 30 mL of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is enough to neutralize the excess NaOH and reach a pH of 7. The number of moles of CH3COOH added can be calculated as: moles = volume (L) * concentration (M). Since 1 mole of CH3COOH contains one equivalent, the number of equivalents of CH3COOH is equal to the number of moles. From here, you can calculate the initial concentration of NaOH.","This is a titration of a strong base (NaOH) with a weak acid (CH3COOH). The equivalence point for this reaction occurs at a pH > 7. Reaching a pH of 7 means the titration has created a buffer solution containing excess acetic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, sodium acetate (A-).
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). With pH=7 and pKa(CH3COOH)≈4.76, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is ~174.
Let M_b be the initial molarity of NaOH. Moles A- formed = initial moles NaOH = M_b * 0.050 L. Moles HA remaining = (2 M * 0.030 L) - (M_b * 0.050 L). 
Solving (0.050*M_b) / (0.060 - 0.050*M_b) = 174 gives M_b ≈ 1.19 M. This rounds to 1.2 M.

The pH of the resulting solution will be determined by the concentration of Na+ ions and Cl- ions.

It states that an excess of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a base, is present. When HCl (a strong acid) is added, the excess CaCO3 will neutralize all of it. The reaction is CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2.

The molarity of HCl is 3 M, so the number of moles of HCl is (45 mL) * (3 mol/L) / (1000 mL/L) = 0.135 mol. Similarly, the number of moles of NaOH is 0.0225 mol. Since there are more moles of NaOH than HCli, NaOH is the strong base that dominates the pH. The reaction is: HCl + 2NaOH → NaCl + 2H2O. Therefore, the pH will be basic and close to 9.","1.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution is entirely incorrect. It uses the wrong volume to calculate moles of HCl, miscalculates moles of NaOH, uses an incorrect reaction stoichiometry (1:2 instead of 1:1), and contradicts its own (wrong) numbers when determining the excess reagent.
