Then, calculate the moles of O₂ produced (4.45 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.139 mol). Using the balanced equation, for every 1 mole of MgO, 1 mole of O₂ is produced. Therefore, 0.139 mol of O₂ is produced from 0.139 mol of MgO. The mass of oxygen in the original sample is 0.139 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 4.45 g.

It misidentifies the reactant as ""magnesium dioxide (MgO)"", provides a nonsensical chemical equation, and violates the law of conservation of mass by stating that 2.00 g of reactant produces 4.45 g of product.

To obtain the intended answer, one must assume the mass of oxygen produced was 1.52 g, not 4.45 g. The problem then becomes a simple percent mass calculation:
Percent mass of oxygen = (mass of oxygen / mass of sample) * 100%

It names the reactant ""magnesium dioxide"" but gives the formula for magnesium oxide (MgO). The chemical equation is nonsensical. The provided masses (2.00 g reactant, 4.45 g product) are physically impossible.

Context Accuracy: The context is completely inaccurate. The chemical name/formula is wrong, the reaction equation is impossible (MgO is very stable and does not decompose this way), and the data violates the law of conservation of mass.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution is a cascade of errors. It uses the wrong molar mass for MgO, invents a mole ratio from a nonsensical equation, and commits a severe arithmetic error, falsely claiming that (4.45 / 2.00) * 100% equals 76.00% when it actually equals 222.5%.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's stated answer matches the key, but the calculation shown to derive it is arithmetically incorrect.
