chemistry,mixtral,struktur1,1,324116,What is the pH of a 0.50 M solution of hydrochloric acid?,2.30,3.00,3.70,4.40,A,"For a strong acid like HCl, [H+] = [HCl], so pH = -log(0.50) ≈ 2.30 (rounded to two decimal places).","Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, meaning it dissociates completely in water. Therefore, for a 0.50 M HCl solution, the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] is also 0.50 M.
The pH is calculated as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration.
pH = -log[H+]
pH = -log(0.50)
pH ≈ 0.301
None of the provided options are correct.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,20004,5.0,2.0,Incorrect,1.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear, unambiguous, and provides all necessary data.
Context Accuracy: The chemical concept is valid, but the question is fundamentally flawed because the correct answer (~0.30) is not among the options. All distractors and the keyed answer are incorrect.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is correct up to a point (identifying HCl as a strong acid and using pH = -log[H+]). However, it makes a critical and large mathematical error, stating that -log(0.50) is 2.30 when it is actually 0.30.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 2.30 is incorrect. The correct pH is approximately 0.30.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Chemistry teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-level quantitative MCQ from: stoichiometry (incl. limiting reagent), concentration (molarity/mass percent), strong acid–base (pH), or simple equilibria.
• Use common atomic masses (H=1, C=12, N=14, O=16, Na=23, Cl=35.5); round to 2 decimals; correct units.
• Distractors: wrong coefficients, wrong mol–gram–volume conversions, log/pH errors.
