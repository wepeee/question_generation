Required H2 = 2 mol N2 * (3 mol H2 / 1 mol N2) = 6 mol H2.
The amount of H2 required (6 mol) is exactly equal to the amount of H2 available (6 mol).

chemistry,phi,struktur1,4,9909,A chemist has a sample of carbon dioxsis that weighs exactly 8 grams and is fully dissolved in water to form an aqua solution with molarity equal to its mass percent concentration.,0.25 M,1.67 M,3.33 M,4.00 M,C,"The molecular weight of CO2 is 44 g/mol (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16x2). The sample weighs 8g so it has approximately 0.18 moles (8g / 44g/mol = 0.18 moles). Assuming the volume of water is sufficient to dissolve CO2 without significant change in density, and given that mass percent concentration equals the ratio of solute's weight over solution's total weight times 100%, we find C as follows: (8g / (8g + Volume_of_water)) * 100%. For a molarity close to its own mass percent, and considering significant figures in measurements for CO2 dissolution typically allow rounding up the result. Therefore, option 'C' is correct.","Let M be molarity and P be mass percent. The problem states the numerical values are equal: M = P.
M = n_solute / V_L and P = (m_solute / m_solution) * 100.
Using density ρ (in g/L) = m_solution / V_L, we can substitute V_L = m_solution / ρ.
The condition becomes: n_solute / (m_solution / ρ) = (m_solute / m_solution) * 100.
This simplifies to (n_solute * ρ) = (m_solute * 100). Since n_solute = m_solute / MW, we get ρ = 100 * MW.
For CO2 (MW ≈ 44 g/mol), this requires ρ ≈ 4400 g/L (4.4 g/mL), a physically impossible density for an aqueous solution.
Furthermore, this condition only determines the required density; it does not provide enough information to determine the concentration.

What mass of Na2O will be produced if 10 grams of each reactant are used?",A: 4.6 g,B: 9.2 g,C: 5.8 g,D: 3.7 g,B,"First, calculate the moles of NaCl and CaCO3 using their respective molar masses (NaCl = 58.49 g/mol, CaCO3 = 100.09 g/mol). With equal masses, we have: ( n_NaCl = (10)/(58.49), n_CaCO3 = (10)/(100.09).) The balanced equation is Na2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + CO2 + H2O, which tells us that the moles of CaCO3 will produce twice as many moles of Na2O (which then produces half its mass in solid form). Since we have more than enough Cl- to react with all available CaCO3 and less Na+ from NaCl compared to what is needed for full reaction, NaCl becomes the limiting reagent. Therefore, using stoichiometry based on moles of NaCl: ( n_Na2O = (1)/(2)n_NaCl,) which gives us 0.0856 moles of Na2O produced.","First, write the balanced chemical equation from the problem description: 2 NaCl + CaCO3 -> Na2O + CO2 + CaCl2.
Next, calculate the moles of each reactant. Molar mass of NaCl is ~58.44 g/mol and CaCO3 is ~100.09 g/mol.
Moles NaCl = 10 g / 58.44 g/mol = 0.1711 mol.
Moles CaCO3 = 10 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.0999 mol.
Determine the limiting reactant. The reaction requires 2 moles of NaCl for every 1 mole of CaCO3. To react with all the CaCO3 (0.0999 mol), we would need 0.1998 mol of NaCl. Since we only have 0.1711 mol, NaCl is the limiting reactant.
Calculate the moles of Na2O produced based on the limiting reactant. The ratio is 2 mol NaCl to 1 mol Na2O.
Moles Na2O = 0.1711 mol NaCl * (1 mol Na2O / 2 mol NaCl) = 0.08555 mol Na2O.
Finally, calculate the mass of Na2O produced. The molar mass of Na2O is ~61.98 g/mol.

Context Accuracy: The chemical reaction described (heating NaCl and CaCO3 to produce Na2O) is highly implausible from a chemical standpoint. Na2O is a very strong base and would likely react with the CO2 produced.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is extremely poor. It begins with a completely irrelevant chemical equation.

chemistry,phi,struktur1,37,12312,A chemistry student needs to prepare a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) by mixing solid NaCl with water and wants to determine how much excess reactant will be formed when using 50 grams of anhydrous NaCl mixed in enough water.

However, since sodium chloride dissolves in water to form a homogeneous solution without any chemical reaction or gas production at room temperature and under normal conditions of preparation (no oxidation process), no excess reactant is formed after the salt has completely dissolved.","The question describes the physical process of dissolving sodium chloride (NaCl) in water. This is not a chemical reaction. The terms 'reactant' and 'excess reactant' apply to chemical reactions where new substances are formed.

The molar mass of NaCl is approximately 22.99 g/mol (Na) + 35.45 g/mol (Cl) = 58.44 g/mol. The question uses 58.49 g, which is a common rounded value or is intentionally set to simplify the calculation.
Moles of NaCl = 58.49 g / 58.49 g/mol = 1.00 mole.
Next, calculate the molarity using the volume of the solution.

chemistry,phi,struktur1,45,12936,A chemist has a sample of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) with a mass of 10 grams and wants to react it completely with hydrochloric acid (HCl). The reaction is NaHCO3 + HCl -> NaCl + CO2 + H2O. What volume of 1 M HCl solution would be needed for the complete neutralization?,95 mL,46 mL,85 mL,102 mL,C,"First, calculate moles of NaHCO3 using its mass and molecular weight (Na=23, H=1, C=12, O=16), which gives 4.75 mmol.

Since we have 1 M HCl (which means 1 mole per liter), to find the volume needed in liters, divide moles by concentration: ( rac4.75 mmol1000 = 0.00475 L ) or 4.75 mL.

Next, find the number of moles of NaHCO3 in the 10 g sample: moles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 84.01 g/mol ≈ 0.119 moles.
The balanced chemical equation shows a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between NaHCO3 and HCl, so 0.119 moles of HCl are required.
Finally, calculate the volume of 1 M HCl solution needed: Volume (L) = moles / Molarity = 0.119 mol / 1.0 mol/L = 0.119 L.

chemistry,phi,struktur1,50,8178,What is the molarity of a solution formed by dissolving 58.49 g of NaCl (molecular weight = 58.49 g/mol) into enough water to make 1 L of solution?,0.1 M,0.2 M,0.3 M,0s,A,"The molarity is calculated by dividing the mass of NaCl (58.49 g) by its molecular weight and then dividing that number by the volume in liters, which gives 1 M.","Molarity is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution.
First, calculate the moles of the solute, NaCl.
Moles = mass / molar mass
Moles = 58.49 g / 58.49 g/mol = 1.000 mol

Next, divide the moles by the volume of the solution in liters.
Molarity = 1.000 mol / 1 L = 1.0 M.
The correct answer is 1.0 M, which is not among the options provided.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,15881,4,5,Correct,5,"Clarity: The question is clearly stated, but the provided options are flawed. The correct answer (1.0 M) is not listed, and option D ('0s') is nonsensical, likely a typo.
Context Accuracy: The problem is a standard and realistic introductory chemistry calculation. The values are chosen for simplicity, which is appropriate.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is sound. It correctly identifies the formula for molarity and performs the calculation to arrive at the correct numerical answer of 1 M.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's calculated answer of 1 M is correct. The error lies in the MCQ's options and provided key ('A'), not in the generator's solution.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Chemistry teacher.
