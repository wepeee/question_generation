H2 is the limiting reactant (2.50 mol H2 needs 1.25 mol O2, but only 1.00 mol O2 is available). From 2.50 mol H2, 2.50 mol of H2O are produced. Convert moles of H2O to grams: 2.50 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 45.0 g. But the oxygen is the limiting reagent, producing 2*1.00 = 2.00 mol of H2O. 2.00 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 36.0 g of water.","First, convert the mass of each reactant to moles using their molar masses (H2 ≈ 2.0 g/mol, O2 ≈ 32.0 g/mol).
Moles H2 = 5.00 g / 2.0 g/mol = 2.50 mol.
Moles O2 = 32.0 g / 32.0 g/mol = 1.00 mol.
Next, determine the limiting reactant based on the stoichiometry (2H2 + 1O2 -> 2H2O). To react with 1.00 mol of O2, 2.00 mol of H2 are needed. Since we have 2.50 mol of H2, O2 is the limiting reactant.
The amount of product is determined by the limiting reactant. From the equation, 1 mole of O2 produces 2 moles of H2O.
Therefore, 1.00 mol of O2 will produce 2.00 mol of H2O.
Finally, convert the moles of H2O to grams using its molar mass (H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol).

chemistry,gemini,struktur3,46,4627,"A chemist reacts 5.00 g of hydrogen gas with 40.00 g of oxygen gas. If the reaction goes to completion forming H2O, what is the quantity of the excess reactant remaining after the reaction?",35.00 g of oxygen,30.00 g of oxygen,5.00 g of hydrogen,36.00 g of oxygen,A,"The balanced equation is 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O. Moles of H2 = 5.00 g / 2.00 g/mol = 2.50 mol. Moles of O2 = 40.00 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1.25 mol. The mole ratio requires 2 mol H2 per 1 mol O2, so 2.50 mol H2 needs 1.25 mol O2. Therefore, oxygen is the limiting reagent and hydrogen is in excess. 1.25 mol O2 * 32.00 g/mol = 40.00 g O2 consumed. 2.50 mol H2 * 2 g/mol = 5 g H2 consumed. Oxygen is limiting. Hydrogen is in excess. The problem asks for the excess quantity of the other reactant, which is oxygen. Initially, 40.00 g of O2 was present. Moles of O2 consumed = 1.25. The reaction requires 2.50 moles of H2 which is what we have. Therefore, all the oxygen is used, and the amount of H2 remaining is 0. Oxygen is limiting, so it's all used up. Since the question asks for excess reactant remaining, the correct answer is the amount of O2 remaining = 40.0 - 5.0 = 35.00 g of oxygen.","The balanced equation is 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. The molar mass of H₂ is ~2.02 g/mol and O₂ is 32.00 g/mol. The stoichiometric mass ratio is approximately 4.04 g H₂ to 32.00 g O₂, which simplifies to a 1:8 ratio.
Initial moles H₂ = 5.00 g / 2.02 g/mol = 2.48 mol.
Initial moles O₂ = 40.00 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1.25 mol.
The required mole ratio is 2 H₂ : 1 O₂. To react with 2.48 mol H₂, we need 1.24 mol O₂. We have 1.25 mol O₂, so O₂ is in excess.
Mass of O₂ consumed = 1.24 mol * 32.00 g/mol = 39.68 g.
Mass of O₂ remaining = 40.00 g - 39.68 g = 0.32 g.
Using the simplified 1:8 mass ratio, 5.00 g H₂ requires exactly 40.00 g O₂, meaning there is no excess reactant. The question is flawed as the correct answer is not an option.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,43297,5,0,Correct,0,"Clarity: The question is well-worded, with clear data and an unambiguous objective.
Context Accuracy: The question is fundamentally flawed. The given masses represent a perfect stoichiometric ratio (1:8 mass ratio), meaning there is no excess reactant. The question asks for an excess reactant and the options do not contain the correct answer (0 g). The keyed answer (A) is derived from a chemically incorrect calculation (40.00 g - 5.00 g).
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is extremely poor. It correctly calculates the moles and identifies the perfect stoichiometric ratio, but then incorrectly and contradictorily calls oxygen limiting and hydrogen excess. It then abandons all chemical principles and simply subtracts the initial masses of the reactants to get the answer, a common but severe misconception.
