Converting mass to volume using a density conversion factor and rounding to two decimal places, we get 67.41 mL ≈ 60 mL.","First, write the balanced chemical equation: CaCO3 + 2HI → CaI2 + H2O + CO2.

From this, we see that one mole of magnesium reacts with two moles of nitric acid to produce one mole of magnesium oxide. Since we have 2.16 grams of magnesium oxide, we can calculate the number of moles of magnesium reacted: 2.16 g / 40.3 g/mol = 0.0535 mol. This means that 0.107 mol (twice the amount) of nitric acid was present initially, as it is the limiting reagent. Since this reaction produces 1 volume of gas for every two volumes of reactant used, we know that 3 volumes of nitric acid were required. Therefore, the excess reactant remaining after the reaction is 2 volumes.","The question is fundamentally flawed and unsolvable. 
1. The reaction described (Mg + strong acid → MgO) is chemically incorrect. The reaction of Mg with a strong acid (e.g., HCl) produces a salt (MgCl2) and hydrogen gas, not magnesium oxide.

chemistry,llama,struktur3,14,15310,A 10.0-g sample of a certain substance is dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water to create a solution with a pH of 4.65.

The sample contains 10.0 g of substance, so the total number of moles is 10.0/18 (molar mass of the substance) = 0.555 mol.

Since the concentration of NaOH is greater, HCl is the limiting reactant and NaOH is in excess.
After the reaction, the concentration of excess NaOH is 0.0500 M - 0.0250 M = 0.0250 M.

From the reaction, we can see that one mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore, the number of moles of HCl required is equal to the number of moles of CaCO3 (15.00 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.150 mol). The volume of HCl required is then calculated as 0.150 mol × 18.0 g/mol × (1 mL / 1.18 g) = 30.0 mL.","The balanced chemical equation is CaCO3 + 2 HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2.
First, calculate the moles of CaCO3: Moles = mass / molar mass = 15.00 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.1499 mol CaCO3.
From the stoichiometry, 2 moles of HCl are needed for every 1 mole of CaCO3. Moles HCl = 2 * 0.1499 mol = 0.2997 mol HCl.
The question is missing the concentration of the HCl solution, making it unsolvable. However, an HCl solution with a density of 1.18 g/mL is typically concentrated, around 10 M. Assuming a concentration of 10.0 M:

chemistry,llama,struktur3,30,18264,"A solution of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is mixed with a strong base to achieve a pH of 7. If 5.00 g of CH₃COOH is dissolved in 250 mL of water to form the initial solution, how many milliliters of 3 M NaOH are required to neutralize the acetic acid?",10,20,25,30,C,"The reaction is CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. The initial concentration of CH₃COOH is 5.00 g / (250 mL x 1 M/L) = approximately 0.20 M. To achieve a pH of 7, the solution needs to be neutralized by adding NaOH until the pH reaches 7. Since 3 M NaOH is used, each milliliter added will neutralize 3 mmol of CH₃COOH. The amount of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) required for neutralization is calculated as: moles of CH₃COOH = initial moles of CH₃COOH - moles of NaOH added; where moles of NaOH added = milliliters of 3 M NaOH x concentration of NaOH. The correct answer is 25.0 mL, which is the volume required to neutralize the acetic acid.","First, calculate the moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH). The molar mass of CH₃COOH is approximately 60.05 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / 60.05 g/mol = 0.08326 mol.
Neutralization occurs at the equivalence point, where moles of acid equal moles of base. Therefore, 0.08326 moles of NaOH are required.
The volume of NaOH solution is calculated using its concentration: Volume = moles / concentration.
Volume = 0.08326 mol / 3.00 mol/L = 0.02775 L.
Converting this volume to milliliters: 0.02775 L * 1000 mL/L = 27.75 mL.

Context Accuracy: The premise is physically impossible. Calcium phosphate is essentially insoluble in water, so a 'solution' of this concentration cannot be made. Furthermore, pure Ca₃(PO₄)₂ is only ~20% P by mass, so a solution cannot be 35.5% P.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is nonsensical. It first misinterprets '35.5% P' to mean '35.5% Ca₃(PO₄)₂'. Then, it performs a dimensionally incorrect and conceptually meaningless calculation (dividing mass by mol-squared) to get the answer. The entire process is invalid.

Given the mass of CaCO3 (1.50 g) and the molarity of HCl (2.5 M), we can calculate the number of moles of HCl added (nHCl = mL x M). Since HCl is in excess, all of it will react with CaCO3. The stoichiometric coefficient for CaCO3 is 1, so the mass of undissolved CaCO3 remaining is calculated by subtracting the reacted amount from the initial mass. The reacted mass is calculated using the moles of HCl and the molar mass of CaCO3.","1. Balanced equation: CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2.
2. Molar mass of CaCO3 = 40 + 12 + 3(16) = 100 g/mol.
3. Initial moles of CaCO3 = 1.50 g / 100 g/mol = 0.0150 mol.
4. Initial moles of HCl = 2.5 mol/L * 0.0350 L = 0.0875 mol.
5. Moles of HCl needed to react with all CaCO3 = 0.0150 mol CaCO3 * (2 mol HCl / 1 mol CaCO3) = 0.0300 mol HCl.
6. Since 0.0875 mol (available HCl) > 0.0300 mol (needed HCl), HCl is in excess and CaCO3 is the limiting reactant.
7. As the limiting reactant, all the CaCO3 will be consumed.
8. Therefore, the mass of undissolved CaCO3 remaining is 0 g.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,34281,0,1,Incorrect,0,"Clarity: The question is fundamentally flawed. It states HCl is in excess, which the numbers confirm, but then asks for remaining CaCO3, implying CaCO3 is excess. Furthermore, all options are physically impossible, as they are greater than the initial 1.50 g mass of CaCO3.
Context Accuracy: The chemical reaction is standard, but the description is incorrect. This reaction consumes a white solid (CaCO3), it does not produce a ""white precipitate"". The products are soluble CaCl2, water, and CO2 gas.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely wrong. It correctly identifies CaCO3 as the limiting reagent, then immediately contradicts this by stating the excess reagent (HCl) will be fully consumed. This demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of stoichiometry.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's reasoning is incorrect and does not lead to a valid answer. The correct answer based on the question's values is 0 g, which is not an option. The provided key (14.0 g) is impossible.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Chemistry teacher.

chemistry,llama,struktur3,49,15812,A solution of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) is prepared by dissolving 5.00 g of CaCO3 in excess nitric acid and then reacting it with a 10.20 M acetic acid solution. What is the concentration of the resulting calcium acetate (Ca(C2H3O2)2) solution? (Assume complete neutralization.),0.50 M,1.00 M,5.00 M,10.20 M,A,"First, calculate the moles of CaCO3: 5.00 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.0497 mol. Then, calculate the moles of acetic acid required for neutralization: 0.0497 mol x (1 mol/2.16 L) = 0.0231 L or 23.1 mL of 10.20 M acetic acid are required. Finally, calculate the concentration of calcium acetate: 0.0497 mol / 0.0250 L = 1.98 M, which rounds to approximately 2.00 M.","The question is flawed, but the intended solution likely proceeds as follows. First, calculate the moles of CaCO3: n = mass / molar mass = 5.00 g / 100.09 g/mol = 0.04996 mol. The reaction stoichiometry, whether with nitric acid to form Ca(NO3)2 or a hypothetical direct reaction to form Ca(C2H3O2)2, is 1:1 between CaCO3 and the calcium salt product. Therefore, n(Ca(C2H3O2)2) = 0.04996 mol. The question fails to provide the final volume. To match option A (0.50 M), one must assume a final volume of 100 mL (0.100 L). Concentration = moles / volume = 0.04996 mol / 0.100 L = 0.4996 M, which rounds to 0.50 M.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,35084,1,0.5,Incorrect,0,"Clarity: The question is fundamentally flawed and unsolvable as written. It omits the final volume of the solution, which is essential for calculating concentration. The described reaction sequence is also confusing and chemically implausible.
Context Accuracy: The chemical premise is incorrect. Reacting calcium nitrate (a salt of a strong acid/base) with acetic acid (a weak acid) does not result in a complete neutralization reaction to form calcium acetate. This represents a significant conceptual error.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is nonsensical. It contains an initial calculation error, introduces random, unexplained numbers (e.g., 2.16 L and 0.0250 L), and performs illogical calculations. The entire reasoning is invalid.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's calculated answer of ~2.00 M is incorrect. It does not match the key (A, 0.50 M) and is not even one of the provided options.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Chemistry teacher.

Moles of NaOH = 35.5 g / 40.0 g/mol ≈ 0.89 mol. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O. Since moles of NaOH are greater than moles of CH3COOH, NaOH is the excess reactant.
