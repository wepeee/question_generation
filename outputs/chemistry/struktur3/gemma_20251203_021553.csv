chemistry,gemma,struktur3,1,29031,What is the mass percent of NaCl in 50.0 g of a solution prepared by dissolving 10.0 g of NaCl in water to make a total volume of 500.0 mL? (Density of the solution = 1.05 g/mL),1.15%,2.00%,3.50%,4.75%,A,"First, calculate the mass percent: (mass of NaCl / total mass) * 100%. The mass of NaCl is 10.0 g, and the total mass is 500.0 mL * 1.05 g/mL = 525.0 g. Therefore, the mass percent is (10.0 g / 525.0 g) * 100% = 1.90%. Option A (1.15%) is incorrect because it uses the wrong mass, and options B, C, and D are rounded incorrectly.",,,,,,,,,"SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Chemistry teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-level quantitative MCQ from: stoichiometry (incl. limiting reagent), concentration (molarity/mass percent), strong acid–base (pH), or simple equilibria.
• Use common atomic masses (H=1, C=12, N=14, O=16, Na=23, Cl=35.5); round to 2 decimals; correct units.
• Distractors: wrong coefficients, wrong mol–gram–volume conversions, log/pH errors.

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity & units: reaction/coefficients/units clear; sufficient data.
• Difficulty target: medium; realistic numbers; 2-decimal rounding.
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible common errors (coefficients, conversion, log/pH).
• Numerical hygiene: significant figures & units consistent; realistic results.

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object.
- Format:
  [{""question"": ""..."", ""options"": [""..."",""..."",""..."",""...""], ""answer"": ""A"", ""solution"": ""...""}]
- Fields:
  * ""question"": one string.
  * ""options"": array of 4 answer-choice strings.
  * ""answer"": one of ""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"" (just the letter).
  * ""solution"": short plain-text explanation (a few lines is fine).
- No extra text before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT use markdown, code fences, or LaTeX ($ or backslashes).
USER: Topic: Chemistry. Create 1 MCQ following the instructions and return a single-item JSON with the ""solution"" field."
