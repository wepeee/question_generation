Moles HNO₃ = 0.0400 L * 0.25 mol/L = 0.010 mol.
Moles Na₂SO₄ = 0.0600 L * 0.15 mol/L = 0.0090 mol.
The reaction given is chemically nonsensical and unbalanced. The correct balanced equation for this double displacement reaction is: 2 HNO₃ + Na₂SO₄ → H₂SO₄ + 2 NaNO₃.
The stoichiometric ratio is 2 moles of HNO₃ to 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.
To react with 0.010 mol of HNO₃, we need 0.010 / 2 = 0.0050 mol of Na₂SO₄. Since we have 0.0090 mol, Na₂SO₄ is in excess and HNO₃ is the limiting reagent.
The moles of H₂SO₄ produced are determined by the limiting reagent: 0.010 mol HNO₃ * (1 mol H₂SO₄ / 2 mol HNO₃) = 0.0050 mol H₂SO₄.
