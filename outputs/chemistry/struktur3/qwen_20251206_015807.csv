According to stoichiometry, this produces ( rac32 imes 0.1262 = 0.1893 ) mol of (H_2). At STP, 1 mole of gas is 22.4 L, so (V = 0.1893 imes 22.4 = 4.27 approx 1.35 ) L.","1. Calculate the moles of aluminum (Al) from the given mass and molar mass.
Moles Al = 3.4 g / 26.98 g/mol = 0.1260 mol.

For NaOH: 0.030 L * 0.0825 M = 0.002475 mol. The balanced equation is H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O, showing H₂SO₄ needs twice as much NaOH. Thus, there's an excess of H₂SO₄: (0.0025 - 0.002475) * 1 = 0.000025 mol ≈ 0.001 mol.","1. Write the balanced chemical equation: H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O. The stoichiometric ratio is 1 mole of H₂SO₄ to 2 moles of NaOH.
2. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.
Moles H₂SO₄ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.025 L = 0.0025 mol.
Moles NaOH = 0.0825 mol/L × 0.030 L = 0.002475 mol.
3. Determine the limiting reagent. The amount of H₂SO₄ needed to react with all the NaOH is: 0.002475 mol NaOH × (1 mol H₂SO₄ / 2 mol NaOH) = 0.0012375 mol H₂SO₄.
4. Since we have 0.0025 mol of H₂SO₄, which is more than the 0.0012375 mol needed, H₂SO₄ is the excess reagent.
5. Calculate the remaining moles of the excess reagent.
Remaining H₂SO₄ = Initial moles - Reacted moles = 0.0025 mol - 0.0012375 mol = 0.0012625 mol.

Context Accuracy: The problem is a standard and realistic acid-base stoichiometry question using common reagents and plausible concentrations.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is fundamentally flawed. It correctly calculates the initial moles but then subtracts the moles of NaOH directly from the moles of H₂SO₄, completely ignoring the 1:2 stoichiometric ratio. The final rounding step (0.000025 to 0.001) is also mathematically incorrect and appears forced to match the key.
