Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object.
- Format:
  [{""question"": ""..."", ""options"": [""..."",""..."",""..."",""...""], ""answer"": ""A"", ""solution"": ""...""}]
- Fields:
  * ""question"": one string.
  * ""options"": array of 4 answer-choice strings.
  * ""answer"": one of ""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"" (just the letter).
  * ""solution"": short plain-text explanation (a few lines is fine).
- No extra text before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT use markdown, code fences, or LaTeX ($ or backslashes).
USER: Topic: Mathematics. Create 1 MCQ following the instructions and return a single-item JSON with the ""solution"" field."
