mathematics,qwen,struktur1,1,3488,What is the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 at x = 2?,A. 8,B. 10,C. 12,D. 14,A,"First, find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5. The derivative is f'(x) = 6x - 4. Substitute x = 2 into f'(x): f'(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.","The function is f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5.
First, find the derivative of the function, f'(x), using the power rule.
The derivative of 3x^2 is 6x.
The derivative of -4x is -4.
The derivative of the constant 5 is 0.
So, f'(x) = 6x - 4.
Now, evaluate the derivative at x = 2:
f'(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,12898,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear, asking for the derivative of a specific polynomial function at a given point.
Context Accuracy: This is a pure mathematics problem. The concepts and values are standard and correct for introductory calculus.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly applies the power rule to find the derivative and then accurately substitutes the value of x to find the final answer. The steps are logical and easy to follow.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 8 is correct and matches the provided key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
