SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object.
- Format:
  [{""question"": ""..."", ""options"": [""..."",""..."",""..."",""...""], ""answer"": ""A"", ""solution"": ""...""}]
- Fields:
  * ""question"": one string.
  * ""options"": array of 4 answer-choice strings.
  * ""answer"": one of ""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"" (just the letter).
  * ""solution"": short plain-text explanation (a few lines is fine).
- No extra text before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT use markdown, code fences, or LaTeX ($ or backslashes).
USER: Topic: Mathematics. Create 1 MCQ following the instructions and return a single-item JSON with the ""solution"" field.

Additional constraint:
- Avoid reusing the following words/numbers: starts, before, then, half, her, unknown, but, cyclist, from, 24, course, with, over, duration, consistent, distance, part, segments, 30, uniform, after, taking, velocity, 340, two, and, that, total, train, increasing, first, pace, destination, 80, travels, 48, rest, maintains, reach, moves, remains, rides, covers, per, final, 2, kilometers, 12, exactly, journey, kilometer, between, speed, increases, completes, for, one, constant, initial, 60, car, hours, hour, accelerates, 5, certain, their, average, steady, uniformly, station.
