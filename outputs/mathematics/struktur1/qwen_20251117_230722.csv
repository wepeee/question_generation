Substituting the given values, P = 2 * (20 + 15) = 2 * 35 = 70 meters. Therefore, the total length of the fencing required is 70 meters.","The problem asks for the total length of fencing required for a rectangular plot, which is the perimeter of the rectangle.
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (length + width).
Given length = 20 meters and width = 15 meters.
Substituting the values: P = 2 * (20 + 15).
Calculating the sum: P = 2 * (35).
Calculating the final perimeter: P = 70 meters.
The correct option is A.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,18987,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is exceptionally clear, with unambiguous wording and all necessary information provided.
Context Accuracy: The context of fencing a plot of land is a realistic and common application of perimeter. The dimensions are plausible.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly identifies the formula for perimeter, substitutes the values accurately, and performs the calculation without error. The reasoning is sound.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 70 meters is correct and matches the provided key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
