The derivative is f'(x) = 6x - 4. Now, substitute x = 2 into f'(x): f'(2) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.",,,,,,,,,"SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object:
  [{""question"":""..."",""options"":[""A. ..."",""B. ..."",""C. ..."",""D. ...""],""answer"":""A"",""solution"":""3–6 short lines, plain text; no LaTeX/markdown.""}]
- The ""solution"" field is MANDATORY with 3–6 short lines (plain text; no LaTeX/markdown).
- No extra text outside JSON; no code fences.
- Options MUST be prefixed ""A. ""/""B. ""/""C. ""/""D. "" and ""answer"" ∈ {A,B,C,D}.
- NO LaTeX: do not use $ or backslashes; write plain text (sin, cos, pi, (a)/(b)).
USER: Topic: Mathematics. Create 1 MCQ following the instructions and return a single-item JSON with the ""solution"" field."
