mathematics,phi,struktur1,1,11695,A function is defined as (f(x) = rac2x^2 - 5x + 3x - 1). What is the value of its limit as x approaches 1?,-1,-0.5,Infinity,Undefined,D,"The function appears to have a removable discontinuity at (x = 1). Factoring the numerator gives us ((2x - 3)(x - 1)), and canceling out the common factor with the denominator, we get (lim_x to 1 f(x) = 2(1) - 3 = -1), but since this is not one of the options due to a mistake in simplification. The correct approach would be direct substitution after canceling out the common factor which gives us (f(1) = rac2(1)^2 - 5(1) + 31 - 1 = rac00), an indeterminate form, so we apply L'Hôpital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator separately. The derivative of the numerator is (4x - 5) which at x=1 gives us 4(1) - 5 = -1; for the denominator it remains as (since its limit will be a constant), hence (lim_x to 1 f'(x) = rac-10). However, this is an incorrect application of L'Hôpital's Rule because after simplification and direct substitution we should not end up with division by zero. The correct limit calculation using simplified function (f(x) = 2x - 3) when x approaches 1 would be (lim_x to 1 f(x) = 2(1) - 3 = -1), which is option B.",,,,,,,,,"SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
