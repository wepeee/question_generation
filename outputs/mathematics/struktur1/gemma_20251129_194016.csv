mathematics,gemma,struktur1,17,2916,"A car is traveling along a straight road. Its position, in kilometers, after *t* hours is given by the function s(t) = 0.5t² + 3t. What is the car's average speed over the interval [1, 3]?",A. 5.5 km/h,B. 6.0 km/h,C. 7.0 km/h,D. 8.5 km/h,C,"Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time. The distance traveled is s(3) - s(1) = (0.5*3² + 3*3) - (0.5*1² + 3*1) = 10.5 - 3.5 = 7 km. The time interval is 3 - 1 = 2 hours. Therefore, the average speed is 7 km / 2 hours = 3.5 km/h.","The average speed is the change in position divided by the change in time.
Position at t=1: s(1) = 0.5(1)² + 3(1) = 0.5 + 3 = 3.5 km.
Position at t=3: s(3) = 0.5(3)² + 3(3) = 0.5(9) + 9 = 4.5 + 9 = 13.5 km.
Change in position (distance) = s(3) - s(1) = 13.5 - 3.5 = 10.0 km.
Change in time = 3 - 1 = 2 hours.
Average speed = 10.0 km / 2 hours = 5.0 km/h.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,31481,5,4.5,Incorrect,2,"Clarity: The question is clearly stated, with all necessary information (function, interval, units) provided. There is no ambiguity in the wording.
Context Accuracy: The context of a car's motion described by a quadratic position function is a standard and realistic problem in kinematics. The resulting speeds are low for a car but physically plausible.
Quality of Working: The generator correctly identified the formula for average speed. However, it made a significant calculation error when evaluating s(3), calculating it as 10.5 instead of the correct 13.5. This error invalidated the subsequent steps.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 3.5 km/h is incorrect. The correct answer is 5.0 km/h. It should be noted that the correct answer is not among the provided options, and the given key (C, 7.0 km/h) is also incorrect.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
