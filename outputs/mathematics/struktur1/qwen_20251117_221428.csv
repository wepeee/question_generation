• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object:
  [{""question"":""..."",""options"":[""A. ..."",""B. ..."",""C. ..."",""D. ...""],""answer"":""A"",""solution"":""3–6 short lines, plain text; no LaTeX/markdown.""}]
- The ""solution"" field is MANDATORY with 3–6 short lines (plain text; no LaTeX/markdown).
- No extra text outside JSON; no code fences.
- Options MUST be prefixed ""A. ""/""B. ""/""C. ""/""D. "" and ""answer"" ∈ {A,B,C,D}.
- NO LaTeX: do not use $ or backslashes; write plain text (sin, cos, pi, (a)/(b)).
USER: Topic: Mathematics. Create 1 MCQ following the instructions and return a single-item JSON with the ""solution"" field.
