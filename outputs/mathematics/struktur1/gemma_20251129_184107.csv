Substitute t = 10 into the equation:

Using a calculator, e^0.4 is approximately 1.49182.

Context Accuracy: The use of an exponential growth model for a city's population is a standard and realistic application. The initial population and growth rate are plausible values.
Quality of Working: The generator correctly substitutes t=10 into the formula. However, the subsequent calculation is completely wrong. The value of 300e^0.4 is approximately 447.55, not 408.40. The solution fabricates a result to match the incorrect key.
