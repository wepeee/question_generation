mathematics,qwen,struktur1,10,5982,A rectangular prism has a base area of 24 square meters and a height of 5 meters. What is the volume of the prism?,A. 120 cubic meters,B. 100 cubic meters,C. 140 cubic meters,D. 160 cubic meters,A,"The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula: volume = base area * height. Here, the base area is 24 square meters and the height is 5 meters. Therefore, the volume is 24 * 5 = 120 cubic meters.","The volume of a prism is calculated by multiplying its base area by its height.
The formula is V = Base Area × Height.
Given:
Base Area = 24 square meters
Height = 5 meters
Calculation: V = 24 m² × 5 m = 120 m³.
The volume of the prism is 120 cubic meters, which corresponds to option A.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,15204,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear, providing all necessary information and unambiguous wording.
Context Accuracy: The problem is a standard and accurate application of a fundamental geometric principle. The values are reasonable.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly states the formula, substitutes the given values, and performs the calculation accurately, including the correct units.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's calculated volume of 120 cubic meters is correct and matches the provided key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
