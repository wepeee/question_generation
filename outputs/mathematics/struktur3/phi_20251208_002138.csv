To find out how many apples 'n' could be bought for this amount with vendor B's offer (which matches direct purchasing cost), we set up an equation where 3 times the number of apples equals n times some unit rate y that represents the bulk deal from Vendor B, which is unspecified but consistent. Since 3 = ny and if 'n' were equal to or greater than 1 per apple (the lowest acceptable cost for a single apple), then one reasonable solution could be buying in quantities where n times some unit rate y equals exactly three dollars when rounded down without exceeding the total direct purchasing price, hence option C: 3 apples.","Let the price per apple from Vendor A be $3. Vendor B's deal is to sell 'n' apples for the price of one from Vendor A, so 'n' apples cost $3. The problem states this is a 'bulk' deal, which implies the price per apple from Vendor B is lower than from Vendor A. So, ($3/n) < $3, which simplifies to n > 1. The question is poorly phrased and provides no further logical constraints to determine a unique value for 'n'. However, a common pattern in such flawed problems is to create a simple symmetry.

The question asks for a selling price that generates a profit. However, the calculated cost per cake is $6.75. The keyed answer, $4.92, as well as options A and C, are all less than the cost, meaning they would result in a financial loss, which contradicts the goal of a fundraiser.

The question's phrasing for the profit goal is also extremely ambiguous.

It contains extraneous and contradictory information (e.g., an initial price of $3). The core instruction for calculating the price goal is fatally ambiguous.
Context Accuracy: While a bake sale is a realistic context, the values provided are inconsistent. The calculated cost per cake ($6.75) makes the keyed answer ($4.92) nonsensical, as it would mean intentionally losing money on a fundraiser.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely flawed. It makes a basic arithmetic error, calculating material costs as $3 instead of $3.75.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator does not provide a final answer or select an option. Its intermediate working is riddled with errors. Furthermore, the provided key (B) is incorrect, as selling a cake that costs $6.75 to make for $4.92 results in a loss, not a profit.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.

mathematics,phi,struktur3,24,14362,"A school club is selling cupcakes to raise funds for charity.

Therefore, each item in Deal B would give x + (0.5 * x) = 1.5x cupcakes but at one-fourth the price of deal A ((1/4) / 1.5 times cheaper).

mathematics,phi,struktur3,37,10999,"A student is planning to purchase pies for a fundraiser by combining apples and bread as ingredients. If one apple weighs approximately 150 grams, two bananas together weight about 240 grams, and the cost of an apple per kilogram is 3; while flour costs 2 per pound with a cupcake requiring 0.5 pounds of it for preparation along with apples in equal proportions by mass, what would be the total approximate price to buy enough resources (apples and bananas) needed if she plans on making one dozen cupcakes? Assume that all units require conversion from grams or pounds into kilograms before calculating cost.",24,36,72,18,B,"First, we convert the mass of one dozen cupcakes to grams: 1 kg * (1/0.5) = 1000 g per cake; thus for a dozen it's 12,000 g total. Since apples and bananas are in equal proportions by weight, we have half of this mass as each ingredient: 6000 g / 2 = 3000 g or 3 kg for both apples and bananas combined. The cost per kilogram is 5 (18/1kg), so the total approximate price would be 3 * 5 = 15.","The question is ambiguous and contains contradictory information.

1. The cupcakes are made of apples and bananas, despite the mention of flour. The final question asks for the cost of apples and bananas.
2. The amount of each ingredient per cupcake is 0.5 pounds, based on the quantity given for flour.
3. The cost of apples, stated as ""3 per kilogram"", is a typo for ""3 per pound"".
4. The cost of bananas, which is not provided, is the same as the cost of apples (3 per pound).

It mixes up pies with cupcakes, bread with flour, and the recipe ingredients (flour, apples) with the items to be purchased (apples, bananas). Key information, like the cost of bananas, is missing, and other data (cost of apples per kg) appears to be a typo. The question is unsolvable without making significant, unsupported assumptions.

Context Accuracy: While the scenario of a fundraiser is realistic, the recipe is not. A cupcake made of 0.5 lbs of flour and 0.5 lbs of apples would be a 1-pound pastry, which is unrealistic. The jumble of unrelated ingredients makes the context nonsensical.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution is nonsensical. It invents a formula `1 kg * (1/0.5) = 1000 g` which is arithmetically wrong and logically baseless. It then makes further arithmetic errors and invents a cost of `5 (18/1kg)` from thin air. The entire reasoning process is flawed and disconnected from the problem statement.

mathematics,phi,struktur3,38,12318,"A student council is fundraising by selling baked goods for a charity event at school. They sell cupcakes and cookies with different prices per item as follows: Cupcakes are priced at 2 each, while cookies cost 0.50 each.

We know that 2*c + 0.50*k = 126, but we don't have enough information to solve this equation directly since there are two variables involved. However, knowing they gave away 3 apple pies as fixed expenses suggests the money made from selling cupcakes and cookies would be less than if all had been sold for baked goods. Since options will reflect common mistakes in calculations or misunderstandings of pricing/sales context here are possible distractors: B) Sell 30 cupcakes, C) Miscalculate by subtracting the cost price from selling price without considering quantity sold, D) Erroneously multiply fixed expenses with quantities. Given that 2*40 = 80 and since they can't sell cookies to reach exactly 126 as per given data (and no cookie sales are mentioned), it is likely the answer refers only to cupcakes.","Let c be the number of cupcakes and k be the number of cookies. The price of a cupcake is $2 and a cookie is $0.50. The total amount raised is $126. The information about the apple pies is irrelevant as it's stated to be a fixed expense not included in the fundraising amount.
The governing equation is 2c + 0.5k = 126.
This is a single linear equation with two variables (a Diophantine equation), which has multiple integer solutions. To find the relationship between c and k, we can write k = (126 - 2c) / 0.5, which simplifies to k = 252 - 4c.
Since c and k must be non-negative integers, any integer value for c from 0 to 63 will produce a valid solution. For example, if c=63, k=0. If c=0, k=252.
The question is ill-posed as it lacks information for a unique solution. However, we can test the given option. If c = 40, then k = 252 - 4(40) = 252 - 160 = 92. Since k=92 is a valid number of cookies, c=40 is a possible solution.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,22389,1,4,Correct,0.5,"Clarity: The question is critically flawed because it asks for a unique answer (""how many cupcakes did they sell?"") but provides insufficient information.

Context Accuracy: The context of a school bake sale fundraiser is realistic. The prices for the items and the total amount raised are plausible for such an event.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is very poor. It correctly identifies the equation but then incorrectly states that there is not enough information and makes a false claim that ""no cookie sales are mentioned"". Its justification for the answer is illogical and does not demonstrate how the answer was reached.

If this deal represents buying in bulk, which expression accurately describes how many apples 'n' could be bought at a total cost equaling that of purchasing directly?",1 apple,2 apples,3 apples,6 apples,C,"If one were to purchase from vendor A, the price per apple is 3. To find out how many apples 'n' could be bought for this amount with vendor B's offer (which matches direct purchasing cost), we set up an equation where 3 times the number of apples equals n times some unit rate y that represents the bulk deal from Vendor B, which is unspecified but consistent. Since 3 = ny and if 'n' were equal to or greater than 1 per apple (the lowest acceptable cost for a single apple), then one reasonable solution could be buying in quantities where n times some unit rate y equals exactly three dollars when rounded down without exceeding the total direct purchasing price, hence option C: 3 apples.","Let the price per apple from Vendor A be $3. Vendor B's deal is to sell 'n' apples for the price of one from Vendor A, so 'n' apples cost $3. The problem states this is a 'bulk' deal, which implies the price per apple from Vendor B is lower than from Vendor A. So, ($3/n) < $3, which simplifies to n > 1. The question is poorly phrased and provides no further logical constraints to determine a unique value for 'n'. However, a common pattern in such flawed problems is to create a simple symmetry. Since the price of a single apple is 3, the most likely intended answer for the number of apples 'n' in the deal is also 3.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,36153,0.5,2.5,Correct,0,"Clarity: The question is extremely unclear. The phrase 'at a total cost equaling that of purchasing directly' is ambiguous and either redundant or contradictory. It is not possible to solve the problem with certainty from the text provided.

Context Accuracy: The context of vendors at a market is realistic. However, '3 per apple' is ambiguous (3 dollars? cents?) and if it means $3, it's a very high price for a single apple, which slightly strains the realism of the scenario.

Quality of Working: The generator's explanation is nonsensical. It introduces an undefined variable 'y' and sets up an incorrect equation ('3 times the number of apples equals n times some unit rate y'). The reasoning is incoherent and does not logically support the conclusion.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer is 'Correct' as it matches the provided key. My independent analysis, despite finding the question logically flawed, also identifies '3 apples' as the most probable intended answer based on guessing the author's flawed logic.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.

The expression becomes [(x - 3)(x + 3)] / (x - 3).
Since x is approaching 3 but not equal to 3, the (x - 3) term is non-zero and can be canceled.
