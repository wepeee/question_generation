mathematics,phi,struktur2,12,41441,"A field has a uniform slope and is represented by two perpends intersecting at right angles over an area of land where one leg measures twice as long as it does across its width when planted with wheat, which yields thrice that amount compared to barley.

Area of wheat yield in terms of height (y) can be given by a proportion: (30 bushels / y^2 acres = Y bushels/h^2), where h represents similar proportions across both crops on this consistent slope, which allows us to compare yields directly without using units. Since wheat yield is thrice that of barley and the area productively used for each crop type remains constant (to maintain land use): Barley: 30 bushels/y^2 acres = G bushels/(h * x)^2, where h equals y due to consistent slope angles. Simplifying this yields a relationship between barley yield per unit width and the proportional height across crops which can be solved for Y (wheat yield), assuming 10 feet as representative of 'x' based on context: G = 3 * 30 bushels/y^2 acres => G bushels/(h*10)^2. Solving this and considering the proportional relationship across barley yields, we find that Y equals twice the yield for one acre width of wheat in barley terms: Y = 2 * (30 * h^2/10^2) bushels => Y = 2 * (30*y^2)/(100), where y is proportional to our given x, thus yield for one foot width of wheat translates directly as twice the barley per acre since we removed all unit terms due to consistency: For each additional inch across this dimension (equivalent to 1/12 feet): Yield increases by ( 2 * 30 / 10^2 ) bushels => Increase = 60/100 */=> for an increase of one foot or roughly three inches, we get: Increase per inch = (60/100) / 3 =~ 0.2 bushels/ ninches yielded by the incremental width => Total wheat yield within this field would be ( x * y^2 + Increase ) assuming 'x' as one foot or twelve inches for barley, thus simplifying to: Yield = 30*h^2/100 - (60-y)*(1) /*=> with an additional increment of three feet perimeter from the shorter dimension on wheat width 'x': yield increases by ( Increase * 48 ) => Yield += 0.2*48 bushels Y = G + Y_incremental, where: G = (30*(1^2)/(10)^2) bushels for the original yield across barley width 'x', thus we find: G = 3 * 3 bushels => Triple that of one-foot increment or Y_incremental, and hence additional: yield gain per foot is ( G + (0.2*48) = 9 + 9.6 ) which simplifies to Option B as the correct answer.","The yield rate for barley is given as 30 bushels/acre.

mathematics,phi,struktur2,16,6285,Given two equations: y = x^2 + ax + b and its inverse yields another equation of form x as a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients; what is correct about these polynomials?,Option A implies that the original has complex roots.,Option B suggests both have exactly one common root at infinity.,Option C means their graphs intersect only once in Quadrant I.,Option D indicates they are reflections across y=x line.,D,"An inverse function switches the roles of x and y, hence it must reflect across the line (y = x). Since one equation is a quadratic polynomial that opens upwards (because its leading coefficient's sign is positive), any reflection will keep this orientation.","The question presents two equations. The first is y = x^2 + ax + b. The second is described as the result of finding the 'inverse' of the first, yielding an equation for x as a quadratic in y. Swapping x and y in the first equation gives x = y^2 + ay + b, which matches this description. These two equations represent an algebraic relation and its inverse relation. A fundamental property of inverse relations is that their graphs are reflections of each other across the line y = x. Therefore, option D is the only statement that is definitionally true regardless of the values of a and b. The other options describe properties (like roots or intersections) that depend on the specific coefficients and are not universally true.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,39757,1.5,2,Correct,1.5,"Clarity: The question is poorly worded. The phrase ""its inverse yields another equation..."" is a confusing and tautological way to introduce the second equation. It should simply state the two equations being compared. The phrase ""what is correct about these polynomials"" is also imprecise; it should refer to the graphs of the equations.

Context Accuracy: The use of the term ""inverse"" is ambiguous. A parabola is not a one-to-one function, so it does not have an inverse *function* without domain restriction. The question refers to an inverse *relation*, but this distinction is not made clear, which could confuse students familiar with the formal definition of inverse functions.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly states the key principle that an inverse implies a reflection across y=x. However, the second sentence of its reasoning is incorrect: it claims the reflection will ""keep this orientation"" (upward-opening), which is false. The reflection of an upward-opening parabola across y=x is a rightward-opening parabola.

The derivative is f'(x) = 2ax + b.
We are given f'(-3) = -7, so 2a(-3) + b = -7, which simplifies to -6a + b = -7.
Option A: 'f'(x) is always negative' means 2ax + b < 0 for all x. This is only possible if a=0, which contradicts the function being quadratic. So, A is false.
Option B: The y-intercept is f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) = 0. The graph crosses the y-axis at zero, not above it. So, B is false.

The smallest values that satisfy the equation c^2 = (a + 3)(b - 0), considering we need positive integers, would be when either 'a+3' or 'b-7' equals to one of its factors due to integer requirement for legs and hypotenuse. After testing each combination within constraints: a=6 & b=11 gives us the equation c^2 = (6 + 3)(11 - 7) equaling 49, hence c = 7; adding these sides together yields P = 6+7+8 which is exactly 21.","Let the legs be a and b, and the hypotenuse be c.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's working does not produce an answer. The provided key is 'C', but the numbers in the question (8 and 22) yield a ratio of 2.75, which contradicts option 'C' (""about twice as long"").
