Evaluating the function at x = 3: R(3) = 2(3)^2 + 15(3) - 20 = 2(9) + 45 - 20 = 18 + 45 - 20 = 43.
The correct maximum revenue is 43. None of the options are correct.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,26721,3.0,1.0,Incorrect,1.0,"Clarity: The question is worded clearly, but it is fundamentally flawed because the correct answer (43) is not among the options.
Context Accuracy: The context is highly unrealistic. A revenue function should be zero when zero items are sold, but here R(0) = -20. Also, an upward-opening parabola is a very poor model for revenue, as it implies revenue per item increases with sales.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning for why the maximum occurs at the boundary (x=3) is correct. However, it commits a major arithmetic error, calculating R(3) as 160 when the correct value is 43.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 160 is incorrect. The correct calculation based on the provided function gives 43. The generator's answer matches the provided key, but both are wrong.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

CoT (few-shot style; hidden 2–3 steps):
• Perform multi-step reasoning INTERNALLY; do NOT reveal the steps.

Style example: plan elimination/substitution for a linear system → compute → choose option.
• Create a NEW problem of the same family (SLE, trig identity+evaluation, derivative+substitution, small-data stats).
• Distractors map to step errors (bad elimination, wrong identity, wrong derivative rule, wrong rounding).

mathematics,llama,struktur2,38,12092,Find the derivative of f(x) = (x^2 + 3x - 4)^2.,f'(x) = 4(x^2 + 3x - 5),f'(x) = 2x(x-2),f'(x) = 4x(x+1),f'(x) = x^2 + 6x - 8,B,"To find the derivative of f(x), we can use the chain rule. Since the inner function is x^2 + 3x - 4, its derivative would be 2x + 3, and then we multiply this by the derivative of the outer function, which is 2(x^2 + 3x - 4). This gives us f'(x) = 2(2x + 3)(x-2), which simplifies to f'(x) = 2x(x-2).",,,,,,,,,"SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
