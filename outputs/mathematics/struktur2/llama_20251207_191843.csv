mathematics,llama,struktur2,1,22138,"Find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 5x - 3) / (x+1), where x is not equal to -1.",(4x+2)/(x+1),(2x-1)/(x+1),2x/(x+1),(2x^2 + 5x - 3)',A,"To find the derivative, apply the quotient rule to f(x). The numerator is a polynomial with degree 2. Take the derivative of each term using power rule, and then simplify. Then, apply the chain rule for the denominator by differentiating x+1 and multiplying by the derivative of the numerator's denominator. Combine these results.","To find the derivative of f(x) = (2x^2 + 5x - 3) / (x+1), the quotient rule is applied: f'(x) = [v(x)u'(x) - u(x)v'(x)] / [v(x)]^2.
Let u(x) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3, so u'(x) = 4x + 5.
Let v(x) = x + 1, so v'(x) = 1.
Plugging these into the rule:
f'(x) = [(x+1)(4x+5) - (2x^2 + 5x - 3)(1)] / (x+1)^2
f'(x) = [4x^2 + 9x + 5 - 2x^2 - 5x + 3] / (x+1)^2
f'(x) = (2x^2 + 4x + 8) / (x+1)^2.
This correct answer is not among the options provided.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,38900,5.0,0.0,Incorrect,0.0,"Clarity: The question is clearly stated, using standard mathematical notation.

Context Accuracy: The question itself is a standard calculus problem. However, all the provided options are incorrect, and the key is incorrect. A question with no correct answer is fundamentally flawed, hence a score of 0.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution is nonsensical. It correctly names the quotient rule but then describes a garbled and incorrect procedure involving phrases like ""apply the chain rule for the denominator"" and ""derivative of the numerator's denominator"". It shows no actual calculation or understanding of the method.

Final Answer Accuracy: The correct derivative is (2x^2 + 4x + 8)/(x+1)^2. The provided key 'A' corresponds to the option (4x+2)/(x+1), which is incorrect. The denominator alone, which should be (x+1)^2, proves all options are wrong.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

CoT (few-shot style; hidden 2–3 steps):
• Perform multi-step reasoning INTERNALLY; do NOT reveal the steps.

Style example: plan elimination/substitution for a linear system → compute → choose option.
• Create a NEW problem of the same family (SLE, trig identity+evaluation, derivative+substitution, small-data stats).
• Distractors map to step errors (bad elimination, wrong identity, wrong derivative rule, wrong rounding).
