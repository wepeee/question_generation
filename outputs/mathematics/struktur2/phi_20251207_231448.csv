mathematics,phi,struktur2,3,6285,Given two equations: y = x^2 + ax + b and its inverse yields another equation of form x as a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients; what is correct about these polynomials?,Option A implies that the original has complex roots.,Option B suggests both have exactly one common root at infinity.,Option C means their graphs intersect only once in Quadrant I.,Option D indicates they are reflections across y=x line.,D,"An inverse function switches the roles of x and y, hence it must reflect across the line (y = x). Since one equation is a quadratic polynomial that opens upwards (because its leading coefficient's sign is positive), any reflection will keep this orientation.","The question presents two equations. The first is y = x^2 + ax + b. The second is described as the result of finding the 'inverse' of the first, yielding an equation for x as a quadratic in y. Swapping x and y in the first equation gives x = y^2 + ay + b, which matches this description. These two equations represent an algebraic relation and its inverse relation. A fundamental property of inverse relations is that their graphs are reflections of each other across the line y = x. Therefore, option D is the only statement that is definitionally true regardless of the values of a and b. The other options describe properties (like roots or intersections) that depend on the specific coefficients and are not universally true.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,39757,1.5,2.0,Correct,1.5,"Clarity: The question is poorly worded. The phrase ""its inverse yields another equation..."" is a confusing and tautological way to introduce the second equation. It should simply state the two equations being compared. The phrase ""what is correct about these polynomials"" is also imprecise; it should refer to the graphs of the equations.

Context Accuracy: The use of the term ""inverse"" is ambiguous. A parabola is not a one-to-one function, so it does not have an inverse *function* without domain restriction. The question refers to an inverse *relation*, but this distinction is not made clear, which could confuse students familiar with the formal definition of inverse functions.

Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly states the key principle that an inverse implies a reflection across y=x. However, the second sentence of its reasoning is incorrect: it claims the reflection will ""keep this orientation"" (upward-opening), which is false. The reflection of an upward-opening parabola across y=x is a rightward-opening parabola.

We are given f'(-3) = -7, so 2a(-3) + b = -7, which simplifies to -6a + b = -7.
Option A: 'f'(x) is always negative' means 2ax + b < 0 for all x. This is only possible if a=0, which contradicts the function being quadratic. So, A is false.
Option B: The y-intercept is f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) = 0. The graph crosses the y-axis at zero, not above it. So, B is false.

Case 2: If y = -1, the equation is 4x - (-1) = 8, which is 4x + 1 = 8. Solving for x gives 4x = 7, so x = 1.75.
