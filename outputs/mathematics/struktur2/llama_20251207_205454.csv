We can find the vertex by completing the square: f(x) = (x + 3/2)^2 - 7/4. The vertex is at x = -1.5, but this point lies outside our interval. We can check that the function is increasing on [0, 6] and conclude that the maximum value occurs at one of the endpoints, which are both less than or equal to 3 (which is larger than any critical points we found).

mathematics,llama,struktur2,30,13405,A small business sells toys at a price of p and has a fixed cost of c = 250. What is the maximum profit that can be made if it produces x boxes of toys?,250 when x = 5,500 when x = 10,1250 when x = 20,there is no maximum profit,D,"The profit made by the business is P(x) = p*x - c. To find the maximum profit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this function. Since p and c are constants, the maximum profit will occur when the first derivative of P(x) with respect to x is equal to zero: p*(1) = 0. This means p = 0. However, since p represents the price at which toys are sold, it cannot be zero. Therefore, there is no maximum profit.","The profit function is P(x) = Revenue - Cost. 
Revenue is R(x) = p*x, where p is the price and x is the number of boxes.
The cost is a fixed cost c = 250. There are no variable costs mentioned.
So, the profit function is P(x) = p*x - 250.
Assuming the price 'p' is a positive constant (as is normal for a business), P(x) is a linear function of x with a positive slope 'p'.
A linear function with a positive slope increases indefinitely as its variable (x) increases.
Therefore, there is no maximum value for the profit; it can be made arbitrarily large by producing and selling more boxes.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,25025,2.5,1.5,Correct,3.5,"Clarity: The question is under-specified. It omits crucial information like the value of 'p' or a demand function relating price to quantity. This makes the problem a 'trick' question about the nature of linear functions, which may be unclear to students expecting a standard optimization problem.
Context Accuracy: The economic model is highly unrealistic. A business cannot sell an infinite quantity at a fixed price due to market demand constraints. The model also unrealistically omits variable costs, which are fundamental to production.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is slightly flawed. It applies the first derivative test (P'(x)=0) to find a maximum, which is a method for finding local extrema. For a linear function, it's better to simply state that the derivative is a positive constant (p>0), meaning the function is always increasing and thus has no maximum. The conclusion is correct, but the justification is incomplete.

The cost is 2x, and the revenue is 5x. Setting them equal and solving for x gives 0 = 3x, so x = 8. The maximum profit is then 5(8) - 2(8) = 28.","1. The profit per unit is the selling price minus the cost per unit: 5 - 2 = 3.
2. The total profit, P, for producing and selling x units is given by the function P(x) = 3x.
3. This is a linear function with a positive slope. Therefore, profit increases as x increases, and there is no maximum profit unless there is a constraint on x, which is not provided. The question is ill-posed.
4. We can check if any of the options are arithmetically correct. For option D, if x = 6, the profit should be P(6) = 3 * 6 = 18.
5. The option states a profit of 12. This is incorrect.

It asks for a 'maximum profit' for a linear profit function (P=3x), which has no maximum. The question's objective is therefore nonsensical as stated.

Context Accuracy: The context of calculating profit from cost and revenue is correct. However, the model is oversimplified to the point of being misleading, as finding a 'maximum' profit for an unconstrained linear function is not a valid business problem.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely wrong. It claims maximum profit occurs when cost equals revenue (the break-even point), which is false. It then incorrectly solves the equation 3x=0 as x=8 and miscalculates the final profit. The entire working is nonsensical.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's flawed logic does not lead to the provided key (D). Furthermore, the key itself is incorrect, as the profit for x=6 is 18, not 12. The generator's solution is incorrect in every aspect.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.

mathematics,llama,struktur2,36,11805,"A company sells toys at a price of p(x) = 2x + 5 and incurs a cost of c(x) = x^2 + 3x. Find the profit function P(x), assuming that the revenue is greater than or equal to the cost. What is the maximum possible revenue?",P(x) = -x^2 + 7x,P(x) = x^2 + 9x,P(x) = 3x^2 + 5x,P(x) = 2x^2 - 2x,A,"To find the profit function P(x), we need to subtract the cost from the revenue. The revenue is given by R(x) = p(x), which is a function of x. We set c(x) ≥ R(x) and solve for P(x). Simplifying, we get P(x) = -x^2 + 7x.","The profit function P(x) is the difference between the revenue function R(x) and the cost function c(x).
The revenue R(x) is the product of the number of items sold, x, and the price per item, p(x).
R(x) = x * p(x) = x(2x + 5) = 2x^2 + 5x.
The cost function is given as c(x) = x^2 + 3x.
Therefore, the profit function is P(x) = R(x) - c(x) = (2x^2 + 5x) - (x^2 + 3x) = x^2 + 2x.
This result does not match any of the options provided. The question is flawed.
Additionally, the revenue function R(x) = 2x^2 + 5x is an upward-opening parabola and has no maximum, so the second part of the question is unanswerable.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,44957,1.0,1.0,Correct,0.0,"Clarity: The question is very poorly constructed. It asks for two values (profit function and max revenue) but the options only list profit functions. More importantly, the functions provided in the stem do not lead to any of the options, indicating a fundamental error in the question's data.

Context Accuracy: The economic context is flawed. A price function p(x) = 2x + 5, where price increases with quantity, is unrealistic. This leads to a revenue function R(x) = 2x^2 + 5x which has no maximum, making the second part of the question impossible to answer.

Quality of Working: The generator's working is nonsensical. It incorrectly states that revenue equals the price function (R(x)=p(x)). It then sets up a nonsensical inequality (c(x) >= R(x)) that contradicts the problem statement. The final answer does not follow from its own flawed logic; it appears to be fabricated to match the key.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer matches the provided key (A). Although the key is incorrect for the question as written, the generator successfully identified the intended answer for this flawed question. Therefore, its final answer is technically 'Correct' relative to the key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
