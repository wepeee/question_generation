What is the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at t = 3 hours?",A. -50 degrees Celsius/hour,B. -20 degrees Celsius/hour,C. 10 degrees Celsius/hour,D. 30 degrees Celsius/hour,A,"First, find the derivative: T'(t) = 10t - 80. Then, substitute t = 3: T'(3) = 10(3) - 80. Simplify: T'(3) = 30 - 80 = -50. The instantaneous rate of change is -50 degrees Celsius/hour.","The problem asks for the instantaneous rate of change of temperature, which is the first derivative of the temperature function T(t).
The function is T(t) = 5t^2 - 80t + 320.
Using the power rule for differentiation, the derivative is T'(t) = d/dt (5t^2 - 80t + 320) = 10t - 80.
To find the rate of change at t = 3 hours, we evaluate T'(3).
T'(3) = 10(3) - 80 = 30 - 80 = -50.
The instantaneous rate of change at t = 3 hours is -50 degrees Celsius/hour.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,29295,5.0,4.5,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear. It provides the function, defines all variables and units, and states the objective unambiguously.
Context Accuracy: The context of a chemical reaction is suitable for a calculus problem. The initial temperature of 320°C is high but plausible in an industrial setting. The model is a reasonable simplification.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is flawless. It correctly identifies the need for the derivative, calculates it accurately, and evaluates it at the correct point. The steps are concise and logical.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of -50 degrees Celsius/hour is correct and matches the independent calculation.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Mathematics teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-difficulty computational MCQ from ONE of: algebra (functions/inverse/systems), trigonometry (identities/evaluation), basic calculus (limits/derivatives/simple integrals), or short statistics.
• Use realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals when needed; avoid formal proofs.
• Distractors must reflect typical mistakes (sign errors, wrong identities, derivative/limit rules, rounding).

CoT (few-shot style; hidden 2–3 steps):
• Perform multi-step reasoning INTERNALLY; do NOT reveal the steps.

Style example: plan elimination/substitution for a linear system → compute → choose option.
• Create a NEW problem of the same family (SLE, trig identity+evaluation, derivative+substitution, small-data stats).
• Distractors map to step errors (bad elimination, wrong identity, wrong derivative rule, wrong rounding).
