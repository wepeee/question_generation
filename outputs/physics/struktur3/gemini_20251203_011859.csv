physics,gemini,struktur3,1,7325,"A 2.0 kg block slides down a frictionless incline of 30 degrees. If the length of the incline is 5.0 m, what is the speed of the block at the bottom of the incline?",4.95 m/s,7.00 m/s,9.90 m/s,14.00 m/s,B,"Use conservation of energy: mgh = (1/2)mv^2. The height h = L*sin(theta) = 5.0*sin(30) = 2.5 m. Thus, g*h = (1/2)v^2, so v = sqrt(2*g*h) = sqrt(2*9.8*2.5) = sqrt(49) = 7.00 m/s.","The problem can be solved using the conservation of mechanical energy. The initial potential energy at the top of the incline is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom.
Initial Potential Energy (PE) = mgh
Final Kinetic Energy (KE) = (1/2)mv^2
The height (h) of the incline is L*sin(theta) = 5.0 m * sin(30°) = 2.5 m.
Setting PE = KE: mgh = (1/2)mv^2.
The mass (m) cancels out: gh = (1/2)v^2.
Solving for v: v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 2.5 m) = sqrt(49 m^2/s^2) = 7.0 m/s.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,18332,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear. It provides all necessary data (mass, incline length, angle) and explicitly states the key condition (frictionless).
Context Accuracy: The values are realistic for a typical introductory physics problem. The concept of a frictionless incline is a standard and appropriate idealization for this level.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is excellent. It correctly applies the principle of conservation of energy, shows all steps clearly, and performs the calculations accurately.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 7.00 m/s is correct and matches the result obtained through independent calculation.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.

physics,gemini,struktur3,2,1992,"A 0.5 kg ball is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity of 8.0 m/s. Assuming air resistance is negligible, what is the maximum height reached by the ball?",1.63 m,2.45 m,3.27 m,4.08 m,C,"Use conservation of energy: KE (initial) = PE (final). Thus, 0.5*m*v^2 = m*g*h. Solving for h: h = v^2 / (2*g) = (8.0 m/s)^2 / (2 * 9.8 m/s^2) = 3.27 m.","The problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. The initial kinetic energy (KE) of the ball is converted into gravitational potential energy (PE) at its maximum height.
Initial KE = 0.5 * m * v^2
Final PE = m * g * h
Setting them equal: 0.5 * m * v^2 = m * g * h
The mass (m) cancels out, so h = v^2 / (2 * g).
Substituting the values: h = (8.0 m/s)^2 / (2 * 9.8 m/s^2)
h = 64 / 19.6
h ≈ 3.265 m, which rounds to 3.27 m.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,22999,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is unambiguous, providing all necessary data (mass, initial velocity) and assumptions (negligible air resistance) clearly.
