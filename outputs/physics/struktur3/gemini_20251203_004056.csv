physics,gemini,struktur3,1,4006,"A 2.0 kg block slides down a frictionless ramp inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal. If the block starts from rest and slides 1.5 m down the ramp, what is its speed at the bottom of the ramp?",3.83 m/s,9.80 m/s,16.97 m/s,32.67 m/s,A,"The potential energy lost equals the kinetic energy gained: mgh = (1/2)mv^2. The height change h = 1.5*sin(30) = 0.75 m. Thus, v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 * 0.75) = 3.83 m/s.","The problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, as the ramp is frictionless. The initial potential energy (PE) is converted into final kinetic energy (KE).
Initial PE = mgh, where h is the vertical height.
Final KE = (1/2)mv^2.
Set PE = KE: mgh = (1/2)mv^2.
The mass 'm' cancels out: gh = (1/2)v^2.
The vertical height h = d * sin(θ) = 1.5 m * sin(30°) = 0.75 m.
Solving for v: v = sqrt(2gh) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.75 m) = sqrt(14.7) ≈ 3.83 m/s.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,16742,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is clearly stated, providing all necessary information (mass, angle, distance, initial state, frictionless surface) without ambiguity.
Context Accuracy: The scenario is a classic and realistic introductory physics problem. The values are reasonable for a lab or textbook example.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution correctly applies the conservation of energy principle. The calculation of vertical height and the subsequent calculation for velocity are both accurate and clearly shown.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's calculated speed of 3.83 m/s is correct and matches the provided key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 medium-level quantitative MCQ from: kinematics (uniform/accelerated/projectile), dynamics (Newton/incline), energy–impulse, or basic circuits (V–I–R).
• Use SI units (use g = 9.8 m s^-2 if relevant); realistic numbers; round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors: typical vector-component/sign mistakes, unit conversion errors, wrong effective forces.

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity & SI: explicit quantities and SI units; consistent symbols.
• Difficulty target: medium (2–3 steps).
• Physical plausibility: order-of-magnitude check; conserve energy/impulse when relevant.
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible typical mistakes (sin–cos component, work/energy sign, wrong unit).
