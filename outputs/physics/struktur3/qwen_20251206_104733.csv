This gives N = mg - F*sin(45) = (3.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) - (2.7 N * sin(45)) = 29.4 N - 1.909 N = 27.491 N.

This means the driving force from the engine (F_drive) must be equal in magnitude to the resistance force (F_res). The problem states F_res is proportional to the square of the velocity, so F_res = k * v^2. The power (P) required to maintain this speed is P = F_drive * v = F_res * v.
