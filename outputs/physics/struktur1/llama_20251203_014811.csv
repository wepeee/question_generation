The tension force (T) exerted by the cable on the elevator is equal to this net force, so T = 3000 N.","1. Identify the forces acting on the elevator: the upward tension force (T) from the cable and the downward gravitational force (Fg).
2. Calculate the gravitational force: Fg = m * g = 1200 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 11760 N.
3. Apply Newton's Second Law. The net force (F_net) is the sum of the forces, and also equals mass times acceleration (m*a).

physics,llama,struktur1,21,15861,A 50 kg person is on a massless elevator that accelerates upward at 3 m/s^2. What is the magnitude of the force exerted by the floor of the elevator on the person?,98 N,100 N,102 N,105 N,B,"To find the force, we use Newton's second law: F = ma. The mass of the person is 50 kg and the acceleration is 3 m/s^2. Plugging in these values gives us F = (50 kg)(3 m/s^2) = 150 N. However, this is the force exerted on the person by the elevator floor. Since we want the magnitude of the force exerted by the floor, we must consider that it is equal and opposite to the weight of the person. The weight of the person is mg = (50 kg)(9.8 m/s^2) = 490 N. Therefore, the magnitude of the force exerted by the floor on the person is also 490 N.","To find the force exerted by the elevator floor on the person (the normal force, N), we apply Newton's Second Law. The forces acting on the person are the upward normal force (N) and the downward force of gravity (weight, W = mg). The net force is F_net = N - W.
According to Newton's Second Law, F_net = ma, where 'a' is the upward acceleration.
Therefore, N - W = ma, which means N = W + ma = mg + ma = m(g + a).
Using g ≈ 9.8 m/s^2:
N = 50 kg * (9.8 m/s^2 + 3 m/s^2)
N = 50 kg * (12.8 m/s^2)
N = 640 N.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,25890,5.0,1.0,Incorrect,0.0,"Clarity: The question's wording is unambiguous and provides all necessary data to solve the problem.
Context Accuracy: The physical scenario and values are plausible. However, the provided options are all physically impossible. Since the elevator accelerates upward, the floor's force must be greater than the person's weight (approx. 490 N), but all options are far below this value. This makes the question fundamentally flawed.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely incorrect. It confuses the net force (150 N) with the force from the floor. It then contradicts itself by incorrectly stating the floor's force is equal to the person's weight (490 N), which is only true for zero acceleration. The logic is invalid.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer is 490 N, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 640 N. The generator's answer also fails to match the provided key (100 N), which is also incorrect.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.
