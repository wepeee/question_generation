physics,llama,struktur1,1,23682,A 2.00 kg block is attached to a horizontal spring with a force constant of 100 N/m. It is displaced by 0.150 m from its equilibrium position and then released. What is its speed when it passes through the equilibrium position for the first time?,1.25 m/s,2.00 m/s,4.50 m/s,6.00 m/s,C,"Using conservation of energy, we have 0.5kx^2 = 0.5mv^2. Plugging in the values, we get v = sqrt(k/m) * x = sqrt(100/2) * 0.150 = sqrt(25) * 0.150 = 5 m/s. However, this is the speed at the maximum displacement. Since energy is conserved and only kinetic energy changes as it passes through equilibrium, we can find the speed at equilibrium by dividing this value by sqrt(1 + k/m/x^2), which equals 4.50 m/s.","This problem is solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. The initial potential energy stored in the spring at maximum displacement is converted entirely into kinetic energy at the equilibrium position.
Initial Energy (at x=A): E_i = PE_s = 0.5 * k * A^2
Final Energy (at x=0): E_f = KE = 0.5 * m * v^2
Setting E_i = E_f: 0.5 * k * A^2 = 0.5 * m * v^2
Solving for v: v = A * sqrt(k / m)
Plugging in the values: v = 0.150 m * sqrt(100 N/m / 2.00 kg)
v = 0.150 * sqrt(50) = 0.150 * 7.071... ≈ 1.06 m/s.

physics,llama,struktur1,2,20133,A car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of 25.4 m/s over a distance of 122 m.

Let the upward direction be positive. The initial velocity is u = +12 m/s. The acceleration due to gravity is a = -g.
The question does not specify the value of g. Testing g = 10 m/s^2, which is common in such problems to yield integer answers:
v = u + at
v = 12 + (-10) * 1.8
v = 12 - 18

Quality of Working: The generator chose the correct formula and variables. However, the calculation is incorrect: 12 - (9.8 * 1.8) = -5.64, not -6.0. The final answer of -6.0 is only correct if g=10 m/s^2 is used, which makes the generator's working inconsistent.
