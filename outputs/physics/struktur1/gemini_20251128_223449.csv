Net force = ma. 20*cos(30) - 2*9.8*sin(30) - 0.1*(2*9.8*cos(30) + 20*sin(30)) = 2*a. 17.32 - 9.8 - 2.70 = 2a. a = 4.82/2 = 2.41 m/s^2. Close to A.,"First, resolve forces perpendicular to the incline to find the normal force (N). The normal force balances the perpendicular component of gravity and the perpendicular component of the horizontal force.
N = mg*cos(30) + F_h*sin(30)
N = (2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.866) + (20 N * 0.5) = 16.97 N + 10 N = 26.97 N.
Next, calculate the kinetic friction force (f_k).
f_k = μ_k * N = 0.10 * 26.97 N = 2.697 N.
Now, sum the forces parallel to the incline (up is positive) to find the net force (F_net).
F_net = F_h*cos(30) - mg*sin(30) - f_k
F_net = (20 N * 0.866) - (2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.5) - 2.697 N = 17.32 N - 9.8 N - 2.697 N = 4.823 N.
Finally, use Newton's second law (F_net = ma) to find the acceleration (a).
