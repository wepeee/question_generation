However, since the box is being pulled at a constant speed, there must be an equal and opposite force applied by the box on the rope. This force can be found using F = m * a, where m is the mass of the box (6 kg) and a is its acceleration (which is 0 since it's moving at a constant speed). Plugging in the values, we get F = 6 * 0 = 0 N. However, the problem states that the tension in the rope is 12 N, which means there must be an additional force applied by the box on the rope to counteract this tension. This force can be found using F = T - m * a, where T is the tension (12 N).

A non-zero net force (12 N tension on a frictionless surface) cannot produce a constant velocity, which can confuse students.
Context Accuracy: The scenario described violates Newton's Second Law (F=ma). A 12 N net force on a 6 kg mass would cause an acceleration of 2 m/s^2, not a constant velocity of 1.4 m/s. The context is physically impossible.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is extremely poor.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 12 N is the correct answer to the question, based on Newton's Third Law.
