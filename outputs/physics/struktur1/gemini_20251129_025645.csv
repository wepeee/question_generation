The component of gravity pulling the brick down the slope is F_parallel = m*g*sin(θ) = 5.0 kg * 9.8 m/s² * sin(27°) = 22.25 N.

1. Calculate the weight: F_g = m * g = 1.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 9.8 N.
2. The drag force is given as F_drag = 4.9 N.
3. The net force is the sum of these two downward forces: F_net = F_g + F_drag = 9.8 N + 4.9 N = 14.7 N.
4. Apply Newton's Second Law, F_net = m * a.
5. Solve for acceleration: a = F_net / m = 14.7 N / 1.0 kg = 14.7 m/s^2.
The magnitude of the acceleration is 14.7 m/s^2.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,17479,4.5,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is clear, but could be slightly more precise by stating ""while moving upward"" instead of ""is launched vertically upward"" to remove any ambiguity about the phase of motion being considered.
Context Accuracy: The scenario is a standard and realistic introductory physics problem. The values for mass, drag, and gravity are plausible and well-chosen for a straightforward calculation.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is flawless. It correctly identifies that both gravity and drag act in the same direction, correctly calculates the net force, and correctly applies Newton's second law.

We only know the initial vertical component of the object's . We need the horizontal component to calculate the kinetic energy (KE = (1)/(2) * m * v^2) at the apex, where the vertical component is zero.","The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by KE = 0.5 * m * v^2. At the apex of a projectile's trajectory, the vertical component of its velocity (v_y) is zero. The total velocity at the apex is therefore equal to the horizontal component of its velocity (v_x), which remains constant throughout the flight (assuming no air resistance). The kinetic energy at the apex is KE_apex = 0.5 * m * (v_x)^2. The problem provides the mass (m = 1.4 kg) and the initial vertical velocity (v_yi = 8.4 m/s), but it does not provide the horizontal velocity (v_x) or enough information to calculate it. Therefore, the kinetic energy at the apex cannot be determined.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,28330,4.5,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is well-posed for testing conceptual understanding but contains a minor typo, stating ""component of is"" instead of ""component of velocity is"".
Context Accuracy: The problem describes a standard projectile motion scenario. The mass and velocity values are physically realistic.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is perfectly sound. It correctly identifies that the kinetic energy at the apex depends on the horizontal component of velocity, which is unknown.

physics,gemini,struktur1,21,2139,A 3.5 kg object is launched at an angle of 53 degrees above the horizontal with an initial magnitude of 14 m/s. Find the maximum altitude reached by the object.

This depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.
1. Calculate the initial vertical velocity (v_iy): v_iy = v_i * sin(theta) = 14 m/s * sin(53°) ≈ 11.18 m/s.
2. At the maximum altitude, the final vertical velocity (v_fy) is 0 m/s.
3. Use the kinematic equation: v_fy^2 = v_iy^2 + 2 * a * d.
4. Rearrange to solve for displacement (d), which is the maximum altitude: d = (v_fy^2 - v_iy^2) / (2 * a).
5. Substitute values: d = (0^2 - (11.18)^2) / (2 * -9.8) = -124.9924 / -19.6 ≈ 6.377 m.
6. This value rounds to 6.38 m, which is closest to option A.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,31285,5.0,4.5,Correct,4.5,"Clarity: The question is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clearly stating the objective. The inclusion of mass is a common and acceptable distractor for this type of problem.
Context Accuracy: The values for initial velocity and angle are physically reasonable. The scenario is a standard, idealized physics problem.
Quality of Working: The generator's method is entirely correct. It correctly identifies the initial vertical velocity and uses the proper kinematic equation. There is a minor rounding error in the final step: (11.18)^2 / 19.6 is approximately 6.38 m, not 6.39 m.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer matches the provided key. The small discrepancy between the calculated value (6.38 m) and the key (6.39 m) is negligible and likely due to rounding conventions used when creating the question.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.
