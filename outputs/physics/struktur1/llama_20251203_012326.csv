Since the object does not move, the displacement is zero, but we must consider the force required to overcome friction. The force of kinetic friction is F_f = μN = 0.4 * 5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 N. The net force acting on the object is then F_net = 20 N - 19.6 N = 0.4 N, and since it's in the same direction as the applied force, the work done by the applied force is W = F * d = 20 N * 3.0 m (since we use 9.8 m/s^2 to find displacement), which equals 60 J. However, this is incorrect because we made a mistake in calculating the work done by friction and the net force. The correct calculation of work done by applied force should be: W = F * d = 20 N * (3.0 s) * 5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 / (3.0 s), which is actually equal to 196 J, but this is not among the options.

Since gravity (49 N) exceeds friction (8 N), the object slides down the wall. The work done by the applied force is W = F * d * cos(θ).

The centripetal force required for circular motion is given by F_c = (m * v^2) / r or F_c = (m * ω^2 * r), where m is mass, v is velocity, and ω is angular velocity. Given that the force applied is 16 N, we can calculate the tension in the rod using the equation T = F + (m * ω^2 * r). First, we need to find the angular velocity (ω) from the given information. We know that the block is rotating with a radius of 0.85 m and is attached to a massless rod. The force applied is 16 N, which is also the centripetal force required for circular motion. Using F_c = m * ω^2 * r, we can rearrange the equation to solve for ω: ω^2 = F_c / (m * r). Substituting in the given values, we get ω^2 = 16 N / (7.2 kg * 0.85 m) = 2.33 rad/s^2.

Since N = 22.0 N and mg sin(30°) = 4.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.5 = 22.05 N, the component of N perpendicular to the plane must be zero. Therefore, the static friction (F_s) is equal in magnitude to mg cos(30°), which can be calculated as F_s = 4.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.866 = 38.1 N.

The component parallel to the ramp is F cos(37°), which provides the net force causing the box to accelerate up the ramp. We can use Newton's second law to solve for the acceleration: a = F cos(37°) / m.","First, calculate the component of gravity acting parallel to the ramp, pulling the box downwards: Fg_parallel = m * g * sin(θ).
