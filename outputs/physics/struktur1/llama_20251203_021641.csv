The total energy of the spring-block system is constant, assuming no friction.

Therefore, KE_max = PE_max = 0.5 * k * A^2.

physics,llama,struktur1,3,13845,A particle of mass 0.45 kg is moving at an initial velocity of 12 m/s and has a kinetic energy of 54 J.

If it loses 20%, then final KE is 80% of initial KE, so (1/2)m(v_f)^2 = 0.8(54). Solve for v_f to get v_f = sqrt(0.8 * 108 / m) = sqrt(86.4/m) = sqrt(86.4/0.45) ≈ 21 m/s.","The question contains contradictory information. The initial kinetic energy calculated from the given mass and velocity is KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 0.45 kg * (12 m/s)^2 = 32.4 J. This does not match the stated initial kinetic energy of 54 J.

Assuming the stated KE = 54 J is the correct starting point:
Initial KE = 54 J.
Energy is reduced by 20%, so the final KE is 80% of the initial KE.
Final KE = 0.80 * 54 J = 43.2 J.
Using the formula Final KE = 0.5 * m * v_f^2:
43.2 J = 0.5 * 0.45 kg * v_f^2
v_f^2 = (2 * 43.2) / 0.45 = 86.4 / 0.45 = 192

Context Accuracy: While the physical scenario (energy loss due to friction) is standard, the numerical values are inconsistent with each other, which is physically impossible. A particle with m=0.45kg and v=12m/s cannot have KE=54J.
