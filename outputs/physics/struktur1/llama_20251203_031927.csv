physics,llama,struktur1,1,21888,"A 2 kg block is attached to a horizontal spring with a force constant of 100 N/m. If the block is displaced by 0.15 m from its equilibrium position and released, what will be its speed when it passes through the equilibrium position?",1.9 m/s,3.8 m/s,5.7 m/s,7.6 m/s,B,"Using conservation of energy: initial PE = 0.5 * k * x^2 = 0.5 * 100 N/m * (0.15 m)^2 = 1.125 J. At equilibrium, all this energy will be converted to kinetic energy: KE = 1/2 * m * v^2. Setting these equal gives v = sqrt((2 * PE) / m) = sqrt((2 * 1.125 J) / (2 kg)) = 3.8 m/s.","The problem is solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. The initial energy is purely potential energy stored in the spring, and the final energy (at the equilibrium position) is purely kinetic.
Initial Potential Energy (PE) = 0.5 * k * x^2
PE = 0.5 * (100 N/m) * (0.15 m)^2 = 1.125 J.
Final Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0.5 * m * v^2
By conservation of energy, PE = KE.
1.125 J = 0.5 * (2 kg) * v^2
1.125 = v^2
v = sqrt(1.125) ≈ 1.06 m/s.
None of the provided options are correct.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,29485,5.0,5.0,Incorrect,2.0,"Clarity: The question is well-defined, providing all necessary variables and a clear objective. There is no ambiguity.
Context Accuracy: The physical scenario and the given values (mass, spring constant, displacement) are realistic for a typical introductory physics problem.
Quality of Working: The generator correctly identifies the conservation of energy principle and correctly calculates the initial potential energy. However, the final step of the calculation is arithmetically incorrect. It states that sqrt((2 * 1.125) / 2) = 3.8, when the correct value is sqrt(1.125) ≈ 1.06.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 3.8 m/s is incorrect. The correct answer derived from the question's data is ~1.06 m/s. The question itself is flawed because the correct answer is not among the options. The generator's answer matches the incorrect key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.
