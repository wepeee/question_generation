physics,llama,struktur1,1,16527,A car travels from rest to a speed of 25 m/s in 5 seconds. What is its acceleration?,10 m/s^2,15 m/s^2,20 m/s^2,25 m/s^2,B,"Acceleration (a) = Δv / Δt = (25 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s = 5 m/s^2. The correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is B.","The problem asks for the acceleration of a car.
Given:
Initial velocity (vi) = 0 m/s (from rest)
Final velocity (vf) = 25 m/s
Time (t) = 5 s

The formula for constant acceleration is a = (vf - vi) / t.
Substituting the given values:
a = (25 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s
a = 25 m/s / 5 s
a = 5 m/s^2.
This calculated answer is not among the options provided.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,15172,5.0,5.0,Incorrect,2.5,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear. It provides all the necessary information and uses standard terminology.

Context Accuracy: The values are realistic. A car accelerating to 25 m/s (90 km/h) in 5 seconds is a plausible performance, resulting in a reasonable acceleration of ~0.5g.

Quality of Working: The generator correctly calculates the acceleration as 5 m/s^2 and correctly identifies that this answer is not listed. However, it then incorrectly states that option B (15 m/s^2) is the closest, when option A (10 m/s^2) is mathematically closer. This is a significant error in reasoning.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's conclusion points towards option B, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 5 m/s^2, which is not an option. The question is flawed because it lacks the correct answer and provides an incorrect key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Physics teacher.

Finally, use Newton's second law to find the acceleration: a = F_net / m = 57.88 N / 150 kg = 0.3866 m/s^2 * (1/3) = 4.5 m/s^2.","First, resolve forces into vertical and horizontal components.
