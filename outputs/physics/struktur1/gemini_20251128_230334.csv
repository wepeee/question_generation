physics,gemini,struktur1,1,3448,A 2.0 kg block is pushed up a 30-degree incline by a horizontal force of 20 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is 0.10. What is the magnitude of the block's acceleration up the incline?,A. 0.51 m s^-2,B. 1.51 m s^-2,C. 2.51 m s^-2,D. 3.51 m s^-2,A,Forces up the incline: F_x = 20*cos(30) = 17.32 N. Frictional force: F_f = mu*N = 0.1*(2*9.8*cos(30) + 20*sin(30)) = 2.60 N. Force of gravity down the incline: F_g = 2*9.8*sin(30) = 9.8 N. Net force: F_net = 17.32 - 2.60 - 9.8 = 4.92 N. Acceleration: a = F_net/m = 4.92/2 = 2.46 m s^-2. Closest answer is 2.51 m s^-2.,"First, determine the forces perpendicular to the incline to find the normal force (N). The normal force balances the perpendicular component of gravity and the perpendicular component of the applied horizontal force.
N = mg*cos(30) + F_app*sin(30)
N = (2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.866) + (20 N * 0.5) = 16.97 N + 10 N = 26.97 N.
The kinetic friction force (f_k) is f_k = mu_k * N = 0.10 * 26.97 N = 2.70 N.
Next, sum the forces parallel to the incline. The net force (F_net) is the parallel component of the applied force minus the parallel component of gravity and the friction force.
F_net = F_app*cos(30) - mg*sin(30) - f_k
F_net = (20 N * 0.866) - (2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.5) - 2.70 N = 17.32 N - 9.8 N - 2.70 N = 4.82 N.
Finally, calculate acceleration: a = F_net / m = 4.82 N / 2.0 kg = 2.41 m/s^2.

1. Calculate the acceleration (a) from the net force (F) and mass (m):
a = F / m = 0.8 N / 0.2 kg = 4.0 m/s^2.
2. Use the kinematic equation for final velocity (v_f) with constant acceleration:
v_f = v_i + a*t, where v_i is the initial velocity and t is the time.
3. Substitute the given values:
v_f = 0.1 m/s + (4.0 m/s^2) * (3.0 s)
v_f = 0.1 m/s + 12.0 m/s = 12.1 m/s.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,21810,5,3.5,Correct,5,"Clarity: The question is very clear. It provides all necessary variables and specifies the direction of the force, making the problem unambiguous.
