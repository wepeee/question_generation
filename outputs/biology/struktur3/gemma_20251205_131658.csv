Then p = 1 - q = 0.5. The carrier genotype (heterozygous) frequency is 2pq = 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5, which is incorrect. The proportion of wide wings is 3/4, so p² + 2pq = 3/4. q = sqrt(1 - (3/4)) = 0.5. Therefore p = 1-0.5 = 0.5.

This is incorrect. p^2 = (3/4). p = sqrt(3/4) = 0.866. q = 0.5. 2pq = 0.866. This is an error. Let's recalculate p and q. p^2 + 2pq = 3/4 and p+q=1. p=1-q.

Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the frequency of the 'w' variant?",0.20,0.40,0.60,0.80,B,"First, calculate the frequency of the dominant phenotype (wide wings): 400/500 = 0.8.

Also, p² + 2pq + q² = 1 (genotype frequencies). Assuming 'W' is dominant, the frequency of 'W' (p) is approximately equal to the proportion of butterflies expressing the dominant phenotype, which is 0.8. Therefore, q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. However, this assumes that all wide-winged butterflies have the WW or Ww genotype. The proportion of wide wings includes both WW and Ww individuals.
