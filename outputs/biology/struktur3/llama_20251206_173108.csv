Since one copy of the recessive variant has a dominant effect, the expected phenotypic result would be for seed production to occur normally.","The question describes a plant that is heterozygous for a gene controlling seed production, meaning it has one dominant and one recessive allele. Assuming a simple Mendelian complete dominance model, the dominant allele will mask the effect of the recessive allele. By convention, the 'normal' phenotype is typically dominant over a mutant or loss-of-function phenotype (like 'no seeds'). Therefore, the heterozygous plant would express the dominant trait, which is normal seed production.

Standard Mendelian crosses yield ratios like 3:1 (simple dominance) or 1:2:1 (incomplete/co-dominance). A 1:2 ratio is non-standard and suggests a more complicated genetic mechanism, such as the presence of a lethal allele. For example, a cross between two heterozygotes (Aa x Aa) where the homozygous dominant genotype (AA) is lethal would result in a 2:1 genotypic ratio of Aa:aa among viable offspring.

biology,llama,struktur3,30,11941,A certain type of fungus has a characteristic that is determined by a single autosomal dominant gene. A cross between two organisms with the normal phenotype produces offspring with the following ratios: 9 normal and 3 affected. What is the genotype frequency of the parents?,The parents are both heterozygous (Rr) with a frequency of 0.7.,The parents are both homozygous recessive (rr) with a frequency of 1.0.,The parents are both homozygous dominant (RR) with a frequency of 0.9.,The parents are all heterozygous (Rr) with a frequency of 0.8.,A,"Given the offspring ratios, we know that R is recessive and r is dominant. The affected offspring must have the rr genotype. Since there are 3 affected out of 12 total offspring, this means that the parents must both be heterozygous (Rr).

The question then asks for the ""genotype frequency of the parents"" and the options include numerical values like 0.7 or 0.8.

Let p be the frequency of the dominant allele and q be the frequency of the recessive allele.
The frequency of carriers (heterozygous, Aa) is given by 2pq, so 2pq = 0.48.
The frequency of affected individuals (homozygous recessive, aa) is q^2.
We also know that p + q = 1, which means p = 1 - q.
Substituting p into the carrier frequency equation: 2(1-q)q = 0.48.
This gives a quadratic equation: 2q - 2q^2 = 0.48, or 2q^2 - 2q + 0.48 = 0.
Dividing by 2 gives q^2 - q + 0.24 = 0. Factoring this yields (q - 0.4)(q - 0.6) = 0.
Thus, q can be 0.4 or 0.6. The corresponding frequencies of affected individuals (q^2) are (0.4)^2 = 0.16 or (0.6)^2 = 0.36.

This is because the carrier individuals are less likely to produce healthy offspring, leading to a reduction in their frequency.","Let's assume the defect is caused by a recessive allele 'd', and the normal allele is 'D'. For the defect to be passed on and for there to be carriers, the parent plant must be heterozygous (Dd), which makes it a carrier. When this Dd plant self-fertilizes, the offspring genotypes are in the ratio 1 DD : 2 Dd : 1 dd. The parent generation was 100% heterozygous (Dd). The offspring generation is only 50% heterozygous (Dd). This means the frequency of heterozygotes (carriers) is halved in each generation of self-fertilization. Therefore, the frequency of carriers decreases.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,22032,3,5,Correct,2,"Clarity: The question's phrasing ""inherits a combination of genes that causes a defect"" is ambiguous. It should have specified that the parent plant is heterozygous (a carrier). Without this assumption, the question is difficult to interpret. Option C's use of ""with each offspring"" is also less precise than ""with each generation"".

Context Accuracy: The biological context is entirely accurate. Self-fertilization is common in plants, and its consequence of increasing homozygosity and decreasing heterozygosity is a fundamental principle of population genetics.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is flawed. It states the decrease is because carriers are ""less likely to produce healthy offspring,"" which implies selection is the cause. The primary reason is the genetic mechanism of self-fertilization itself, which automatically halves the proportion of heterozygotes each generation, even without any selection pressure.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator correctly identifies option C as the answer, despite the weak reasoning.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

The expected genotype frequency in a self-fertilizing population is not a fixed constant. Self-fertilization is a form of inbreeding that increases homozygosity each generation, violating Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumptions. The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) depends on the initial allele frequencies and the number of generations of selfing. Furthermore, a gene that ""causes a defect"" implies negative selection, which would also alter frequencies. Without initial conditions (e.g., allele frequencies, selection coefficient), no specific numerical answer can be determined.

Context Accuracy: The biological scenario is plausible, but the premise that there is a single, universal expected frequency for this situation is incorrect according to population genetics principles. The frequency is dynamic, not static.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely incorrect. It misstates the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which doesn't predict a frequency of 0.25), and then incorrectly applies it to a self-fertilizing (non-randomly mating) population. The conclusion is a non-sequitur.
