biology,gemini,struktur3,1,7008,"In a population of butterflies, the allele for black wings (B) is dominant over the allele for white wings (b). If 16% of the butterflies are white-winged, what is the predicted frequency of the dominant B allele, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",0.16,0.36,0.40,0.60,D,"Given q^2 = 0.16 (frequency of bb), then q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant B allele is 0.60.","The problem provides the frequency of the recessive phenotype (white wings, genotype bb), which is 16% or 0.16. In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, this corresponds to q^2.
So, q^2 = 0.16.
The frequency of the recessive allele (b), q, is the square root of q^2.
q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4.
The sum of the allele frequencies in a population is 1, so p + q = 1.
The frequency of the dominant allele (B), p, is therefore 1 - q.
p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,14731,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is exceptionally clear. It defines all variables, states the dominance relationship, provides the necessary data, and specifies the required assumption (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
Context Accuracy: The context is a classic, biologically plausible example used to teach population genetics. The values are clean and appropriate for an educational setting.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is perfect. It correctly identifies the given value as q^2, calculates q, and then uses the p + q = 1 relationship to find p. The logic is sound and the arithmetic is correct.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 0.60 is correct.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.

If 84 out of 400 plants exhibit wrinkled seeds, what is the approximate frequency of the 'S' version in this group?",0.21,0.46,0.54,0.79,C,"First, calculate the frequency of the ss genotype: 84/400 = 0.21. Then, find the frequency of the 's' version: sqrt(0.21) ≈ 0.46. Finally, calculate the frequency of the 'S' version using p + q = 1: 1 - 0.46 = 0.54.","The problem assumes Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the recessive phenotype (wrinkled seeds, genotype 'ss') is the number of affected individuals divided by the total population.
Frequency of ss (q²) = 84 / 400 = 0.21.
The frequency of the recessive allele 's' (q) is the square root of the genotype frequency.
q = sqrt(0.21) ≈ 0.458.
Since the sum of allele frequencies is 1 (p + q = 1), the frequency of the dominant allele 'S' (p) can be calculated.
