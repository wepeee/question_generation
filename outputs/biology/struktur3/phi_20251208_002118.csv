Therefore, differential reproductive success is not a requirement for genetic equilibrium and can even disrupt it if certain phenotypes are favored.","The Hardy-Weinberg principle describes a non-evolving population.

This suggests a deviation from simple Mendelian inheritance. Option A is too extreme. Option D (environment) is less likely in a genetics context. Both Option B (gene linkage) and Option C (epistasis via enzyme disruption) are valid non-Mendelian mechanisms that could explain a limited set of phenotypes.

The term 'black or green albinism' is biologically nonsensical and undefined. It fails to provide enough information to definitively distinguish between the two most plausible options (B and C), making the question fundamentally ambiguous.

Context Accuracy: The core premise relies on the term 'albinism' being associated with black or green colors. Albinism is the lack of pigment (white/pale), while black is a pigment. This central concept is biologically inaccurate.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is superficial. It correctly identifies linkage as a non-Mendelian pattern but then makes a significant conceptual error by stating it involves 'linking white with yellow' (phenotypes), rather than linking genes.

biology,phi,struktur3,12,15305,In a pea plant offspring exhibiting white flowers when crossed with red flower plants is observed.,The white color gene must be recessive and linked to alleles for yellow petal production,White coloration in the progeny suggests incomplete dominance between two different colored parent pea plants' genes,A mutation has occurred within a flower pigment producing enzyme resulting in white flowers when paired with red ones,The observed phenotype implies epistatic interaction where one gene masks the expression of another color-related gene,D,"This question is referring to a case that might appear in genetic studies within ecosystems. The key here lies not just in understanding dominance, but also how different alleles can interact or be overshadowed by one another (epistasis). Since the white flower phenomenon occurs alongside red flowers without mentioning any other specific pigment interactions such as incomplete dominance or linkage to yellow petal production and considering that mutations typically result in new phenotypes not seen before, it implies an epistatic interaction where a gene's effect is suppressed by another. This makes option D the best answer.","The question describes observing white-flowered offspring from a cross involving a red-flowered pea plant. This outcome can be explained by several genetic principles. Let's analyze the options. Option B (incomplete dominance) is incorrect, as it would yield an intermediate phenotype (e.g., pink). Option C (de novo mutation) is a less probable explanation for a standard cross than inheritance. Option A correctly identifies white as likely recessive but adds an unsubstantiated claim about linkage. Option D describes epistasis, where one gene's expression is masked by another (e.g., a gene for 'no pigment' masking a gene for 'red pigment').

Parent 1 is homozygous dominant for yellow seeds, so its genotype is YY.
Parent 2 ""exhibits green due to incomplete dominance."" This implies that green is the intermediate phenotype of a heterozygote. So, Parent 2's genotype is Yy.
The cross is therefore YY x Yy.
A Punnett square for this cross yields offspring with genotypes 1/2 YY and 1/2 Yy.

The phrase ""the other plant's seed color is unknown but exhibits green due to incomplete dominance"" is contradictory and forces the solver to make a significant, non-obvious assumption that green is the heterozygous phenotype.

Context Accuracy: The question is contextually flawed. It uses the term ""Mendelian cross"" but describes incomplete dominance, which is a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. The scenario also contradicts the classic example of pea seed color, where yellow is completely dominant to green, adding to the confusion.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is very poor. It incorrectly defines incomplete dominance by stating alleles are ""expressed equally,"" which describes codominance. The explanation fails to detail the necessary cross (YY x Yy) or use a Punnett square to show how the 1:1 ratio is achieved. The reasoning does not logically support the answer.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer is correct. Despite the flawed question and the generator's poor reasoning, it selects the intended answer (B) which can be reached through a specific, albeit convoluted, interpretation of the question's premises.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

biology,phi,struktur3,49,12515,"In a Hardy–Weinberg study involving two traits controlled by different pairs of genes with complete dominance patterns, what is expected when mating occurs between heterozygous individuals for both traits?",F2 offspring will all show the dominant phenotype.,The F1 generation's phenotypes are unaffected in appearance and function.,None of these options accurately predict outcomes based on Mendelian genetics principles.,,C,"Based on classical Mendelian inheritance, when heterozygous individuals mate for both traits (assuming independent assortment), their offspring have a 75% chance of displaying the dominant phenotype and a 25% chance of showing the recessive combined in one trait. Therefore, not all will show only the dominant appearance.","The question describes a dihybrid cross between two individuals heterozygous for both traits (e.g., AaBb x AaBb). Assuming complete dominance and independent assortment, the expected phenotypic ratio in the offspring is 9 (dominant, dominant) : 3 (dominant, recessive) : 3 (recessive, dominant) : 1 (recessive, recessive).

Option A is incorrect because only 9/16 of the offspring will show both dominant phenotypes, not all of them.
Option B is irrelevant as it discusses the parental (F1) generation, not the offspring (F2) which the question asks about.
Since options A and B are incorrect, option C is the correct answer.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,24643,1.5,1,Correct,1.5,"Clarity: The question is very confusing. It incorrectly frames a simple Mendelian dihybrid cross within the context of a ""Hardy–Weinberg study,"" which applies to population genetics, not individual crosses. Option B is also vaguely worded and irrelevant to the question asked.

Context Accuracy: The premise is conceptually incorrect. Hardy-Weinberg principles describe allele frequencies in a non-evolving population under specific conditions (like random mating), whereas this question describes a specific, non-random cross between two individuals of known genotype.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is flawed. It incorrectly states that offspring have a ""75% chance of displaying the dominant phenotype,"" which is the probability for a monohybrid cross, not a dihybrid one. The correct probability of showing both dominant phenotypes is 9/16 or 56.25%. The reasoning is unsound despite reaching a correct conclusion about option A being false.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's implicit answer, matching the provided key 'C', is correct. Options A and B are demonstrably false or irrelevant based on fundamental Mendelian principles, leaving C as the only viable choice.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

biology,phi,struktur3,50,7954,In a garden of flowering plants where white and yellow flowers are present but no black or green albinism is observed among offspring,The laws of heredity have been violated.,Non-Mendelian inheritance patterns may be at play due to gene linkage preventing recombination between the flower color genes.,Flower pigment synthesis enzyme disruption could cause an unexpected phenotype distribution in offspring.,Environmental factors directly causing changes in petal colors without alterations in plant DNA.,B,"Non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, such as those due to gene linkage and lack of recombination between the flower color genes (in this case linking white with yellow), can cause deviations from expected Mendelian ratios. This implies that while simple dominant/recessive relationships might not explain the absence of black or green albinism in offspring, there could be other factors at work such as linked gene inheritance.","The question presents a scenario where observed offspring phenotypes (white and yellow flowers) are limited, while other potential phenotypes (described confusingly as 'black or green albinism') are absent. This suggests a deviation from simple Mendelian inheritance. Option A is too extreme. Option D (environment) is less likely in a genetics context. Both Option B (gene linkage) and Option C (epistasis via enzyme disruption) are valid non-Mendelian mechanisms that could explain a limited set of phenotypes. Without more information to distinguish between them, the question is ambiguous. However, if one interprets 'white and yellow' as parental phenotypes and 'black and green' as absent recombinant phenotypes, then gene linkage (B) is a direct explanation for the lack of recombination.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,36998,1,1,Correct,2,"Clarity: The question is extremely unclear. The term 'black or green albinism' is biologically nonsensical and undefined. It fails to provide enough information to definitively distinguish between the two most plausible options (B and C), making the question fundamentally ambiguous.

Context Accuracy: The core premise relies on the term 'albinism' being associated with black or green colors. Albinism is the lack of pigment (white/pale), while black is a pigment. This central concept is biologically inaccurate.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is superficial. It correctly identifies linkage as a non-Mendelian pattern but then makes a significant conceptual error by stating it involves 'linking white with yellow' (phenotypes), rather than linking genes. This demonstrates a poor understanding of the mechanism.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's choice of B is 'Correct' in that it matches the provided key and is one of two plausible answers to a poorly constructed question.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
