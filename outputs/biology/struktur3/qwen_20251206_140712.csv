biology,qwen,struktur3,49,14801,"A certain species of beetle has a population where the allele for long wing lengths is dominant over the allele for short wing lengths.

Using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can calculate the frequencies. First, determine ( p^2 + 2pq = 0.72 ), where ( q^2 = rac56200 = 0.28 ). Therefore, ( q = sqrt0.28 approx 0.53 ) and ( p = 1 - 0.53 = 0.47 ). The frequency of homozygous dominant (LL) individuals is ( p^2 = (0.47)^2 approx 0.22 ), which rounds to 0.20 or close to 0.22, but the closest choice provided is 0.48.","The frequency of the recessive phenotype (short wings, genotype ll) is equal to the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (q^2).
q^2 = (Number of short-winged beetles) / (Total beetles) = 56 / 200 = 0.28.
The frequency of the recessive allele (l) is q = sqrt(0.28) ≈ 0.529.
Since p + q = 1, the frequency of the dominant allele (L) is p = 1 - 0.529 = 0.471.
The question asks for the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (LL), which is p^2.

Context Accuracy: The biological scenario is a classic and realistic example used for teaching Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Quality of Working: The generator's initial steps are correct (calculating q^2, q, p, and p^2 ≈ 0.22). However, its conclusion is completely illogical. It correctly calculates the answer to be ~0.22, but then claims that 0.48 is the closest choice, which is false. This appears to be a flawed attempt to match the incorrect provided key.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's calculation correctly points towards an answer of ~0.22 (closest to option D), but its final conclusion supports option A (0.48), which is incorrect. The provided key is also incorrect; 0.48 is approximately the heterozygous frequency (2pq), not the homozygous dominant frequency (p^2).","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
