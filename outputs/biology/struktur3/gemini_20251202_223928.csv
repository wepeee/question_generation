biology,gemini,struktur3,1,3567,"In a population of butterflies, the allele for black wings (B) is dominant over the allele for white wings (b). If 16% of the butterflies in the population have white wings, what is the frequency of the B allele, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",0.16,0.36,0.40,0.60,D,"Given q^2 = 0.16 (frequency of bb genotype), then q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 (frequency of b allele). Since p + q = 1, then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Therefore, the frequency of the B allele (p) is 0.60.","The problem states that 16% of the butterflies have white wings. Since white wings (b) is a recessive trait, the genotype must be bb. In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb) is represented by q^2.
Therefore, q^2 = 0.16.
The frequency of the recessive allele (b), represented by q, is the square root of q^2.
q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4.
The sum of the allele frequencies in a population is 1, so p + q = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (B).
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.
The frequency of the B allele is 0.60.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,14245,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear. It defines the alleles, dominance relationship, provides the necessary phenotype frequency, and states the key assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Context Accuracy: The context is a classic and biologically plausible example used in genetics education. The values are reasonable for a textbook problem.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is flawless. It correctly identifies the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (q^2), calculates the recessive allele frequency (q), and then uses the p + q = 1 formula to find the dominant allele frequency (p).
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer of 0.60 is correct, matching the independent calculation.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.
