biology,gemini,struktur3,1,2979,"In a population of butterflies, the allele for black wings (B) is dominant over the allele for white wings (b). If 16% of the butterfly population has white wings, what is the frequency of the dominant B allele, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",0.04,0.36,0.40,0.60,D,"The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb) is 0.16, so q^2 = 0.16. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele (b) is q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, the frequency of the dominant allele (B) is p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.","The problem states that 16% of the population has white wings, which is the recessive phenotype. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb) is represented by q^2.
Therefore, q^2 = 0.16.
The frequency of the recessive allele (b), represented by q, is the square root of q^2.
q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4.
The sum of allele frequencies is 1 (p + q = 1), where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (B).
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.
The frequency of the dominant B allele is 0.60.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,14732,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is exceptionally clear. It defines the alleles, their dominance relationship, provides the necessary data (phenotype frequency), and states the key assumption (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
Context Accuracy: The scenario is a classic and realistic example used in introductory genetics. The values are plausible and the application of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is correct.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is perfect. It correctly equates the recessive phenotype frequency with q^2, accurately calculates q, and then correctly uses the p + q = 1 formula to find p. The logic is sound and the arithmetic is correct.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 0.6 is correct and matches the provided key.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.
