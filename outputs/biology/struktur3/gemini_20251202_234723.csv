biology,gemini,struktur3,15,2551,"In a certain fish hatchery, the scale coloration is controlled by a single autosomal locus.

Therefore, the frequency of the 's' allele is q = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6.

biology,gemini,struktur3,48,6307,"In a specific area, the proportion of organisms displaying a particular physical feature is observed. If 91% of these organisms show the feature, and it is known to be autosomal, what can be inferred about the underlying genetic makeup?",The physical feature is definitely governed by a completely superior genetic factor.,The majority of the organisms are likely homozygous for the genetic factor governing the feature.,The genetic factor for the physical feature is becoming less common.,"The physical feature is probably not determined by genetics, but by the surroundings.",B,A physical feature seen in 91% of a group doesn't directly imply superiority of the genetic factor. It suggests a high prevalence. High prevalence suggests many are homozygous. It doesn't imply the surroundings are the cause. It doesn't imply it's becoming less common.,"This is a population genetics problem. Let p and q be the frequencies of the two alleles. The total frequency of homozygous individuals in the population is p^2 + q^2. This sum is minimized at 0.5 when p=q=0.5. A phenotype frequency of 91% (or its complement, 9%) requires that the allele frequencies are not 0.5.
If the trait is dominant, the recessive phenotype (aa) has frequency q^2 = 1 - 0.91 = 0.09. Then q=0.3 and p=0.7. The total frequency of homozygotes (AA + aa) is p^2 + q^2 = 0.7^2 + 0.3^2 = 0.49 + 0.09 = 0.58. This is a majority.
If the trait is recessive, its frequency is q^2 = 0.91. Then q ≈ 0.954 and p ≈ 0.046. The total frequency of homozygotes is p^2 + q^2 ≈ (0.046)^2 + 0.91 ≈ 0.912. This is also a majority.
Thus, regardless of dominance, a majority of the organisms are likely homozygous at this locus.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,35622,3.5,5,Correct,4.5,"Clarity: The question uses non-standard terminology like ""completely superior genetic factor"" instead of ""dominant allele,"" and the phrasing of option B is slightly ambiguous. However, the overall intent is decipherable.
Context Accuracy: The scenario is a standard and realistic application of population genetics principles (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is logically sound and correctly identifies the core concept that high prevalence implies a high degree of homozygosity. It correctly refutes the other options. The explanation is concise and accurate, though it lacks a quantitative demonstration.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's choice of B is correct. As demonstrated by Hardy-Weinberg calculations, a phenotype frequency of 91% necessitates that the total frequency of homozygotes in the population is greater than 50%.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

A. Photosynthesis moves carbon from the abiotic atmosphere (CO2) to biotic organisms (sugars).
B. Decomposition involves organisms like bacteria and fungi breaking down dead organic matter (biotic) and releasing carbon dioxide through respiration into the atmosphere (abiotic). This matches the required direction of flow.
