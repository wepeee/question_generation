biology,gemini,struktur3,1,15397,"In a population of butterflies, the allele for orange wings (O) is dominant over the allele for white wings (o). If 16% of the butterflies are white-winged, what is the predicted frequency of the dominant O allele, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",0.16,0.36,0.40,0.60,D,"Given q^2 = 0.16, then q (frequency of o) = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, then p (frequency of O) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.","The problem states that 16% of the butterflies are white-winged. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the homozygous recessive phenotype (white wings, genotype oo) is represented by q^2.
Therefore, q^2 = 0.16.
The frequency of the recessive allele (o), represented by q, is the square root of q^2.
q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4.
The sum of the allele frequencies in a population is 1, so p + q = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (O).
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.
The predicted frequency of the dominant O allele is 0.60.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,14542,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is perfectly clear. It defines the alleles, dominance, phenotype frequency, and the required assumption (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
Context Accuracy: The context is a standard and biologically sound example for a population genetics problem. The values are plausible and well-suited for the calculation.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is concise and follows the correct logical steps. It correctly identifies q^2, calculates q, and then solves for p using the p+q=1 equation.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's final answer of 0.6 is correct.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.

biology,gemini,struktur3,2,2982,"In a certain plant species, the smooth seed shape (S) is completely masking the wrinkled seed shape (s). If 64 out of 100 plants display wrinkled seeds, what is the approximate frequency of the 'S' version of the gene in this group?",0.36,0.40,0.60,0.64,B,"Since wrinkled seeds only appear in ss individuals, the frequency of ss (q^2) is 64/100 = 0.64. Therefore, q = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. Since p + q = 1, the frequency of S (p) is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. However, this is NOT one of the choices. There's an error in the question. If 36 plants displayed wrinkled seeds, then 36/100 = 0.36, and q = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6. p = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.","The wrinkled seed phenotype corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype 'ss'. The frequency of this genotype (q²) is given as 64/100 = 0.64. The frequency of the recessive allele 's' (q) is the square root of q², which is sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. Since allele frequencies must sum to 1 (p + q = 1), the frequency of the dominant allele 'S' (p) is 1 - q. Therefore, p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Context Accuracy: The biological context of complete dominance in pea plants and the application of Hardy-Weinberg principles are accurate and standard. The values are plausible as frequencies.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is excellent. It correctly solves the problem as written, identifies the contradiction with the options, and accurately deduces the likely intended question and answer (that 36 plants, not 64, should have been wrinkled).
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator correctly identifies that the intended answer is 0.40, which matches the provided key. It achieves this by correctly diagnosing the error in the question's premise.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
