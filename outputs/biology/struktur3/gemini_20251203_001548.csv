It suggests a high prevalence. High prevalence suggests many are homozygous. It doesn't imply the surroundings are the cause. It doesn't imply it's becoming less common.,"This is a population genetics problem. Let p and q be the frequencies of the two alleles. The total frequency of homozygous individuals in the population is p^2 + q^2. This sum is minimized at 0.5 when p=q=0.5.

biology,gemini,struktur3,15,2210,"In a specific section of a woodland, the number of deer is increasing. These deer consume shrubs and young trees. What is the MOST LIKELY short-term consequence of this increased deer number?",Increased biodiversity due to deer activity.,Decreased competition among the deer.,Reduced abundance of shrubs and young trees.,Enhanced growth of all plant life as deer fertilize the soil.,C,An increased deer number means more consumption of shrubs and young trees. This leads to a reduction in their numbers. The other options are not direct results of increased herbivory. Increased browsing pressure reduces the number of available resources.,"The question describes a predator-prey relationship, specifically herbivory. An increasing population of herbivores (deer) will consume more of their food source (shrubs and young trees).
This increased consumption, or browsing pressure, will directly lead to a decrease in the population of the plants they eat.
Therefore, the most likely and immediate short-term consequence is a reduced abundance of shrubs and young trees.
Option A is unlikely as overgrazing often reduces biodiversity. Option B is the opposite of what would happen; competition would increase. Option D is incorrect because the negative effect of consumption would far outweigh any minor fertilization effect in the short term.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,28131,5.0,5.0,Correct,5.0,"Clarity: The question is very clearly worded, presenting a simple and understandable ecological scenario. The options are distinct and unambiguous.
Context Accuracy: The scenario is a classic, realistic example of population dynamics and the impact of herbivores on an ecosystem. The ecological principles are sound.
Quality of Working: The generator's explanation is concise and logically sound. It correctly identifies the direct cause-and-effect relationship between an increased herbivore population and its food source.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's reasoning correctly supports the provided key (C), which is the correct answer based on fundamental ecological principles.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object.
- Format:
  [{""question"": ""..."", ""options"": [""..."",""..."",""..."",""...""], ""answer"": ""A"", ""solution"": ""...""}]
- Fields:
  * ""question"": one string.
  * ""options"": array of 4 answer-choice strings.
  * ""answer"": one of ""A"",""B"",""C"",""D"" (just the letter).
  * ""solution"": short plain-text explanation (a few lines is fine).
- No extra text before or after the JSON.

STRICT FOR GEMINI:
- Output plain-text JSON only; do not use LaTeX ($ or backslashes).
- The ""solution"" must be 3–6 lines, plain text.
