Energy in Grasshoppers (Trophic Level 2) = 10% of 10,000 kJ = 1,000 kJ.
Energy in Snakes (Trophic Level 3) = 10% of 1,000 kJ = 100 kJ.
Energy transferred to Hawks (Trophic Level 4) = 10% of 100 kJ = 10 kJ.
Therefore, the hawk trophic level is expected to contain approximately 10 kJ of energy.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,50791,4.0,5.0,Incorrect,1.0,"Clarity: The question is mostly clear, but the phrase 'transferred to the hawk trophic level' can be slightly ambiguous. It typically means the energy assimilated by the hawks (10 kJ), but could be misinterpreted as the energy available in the snakes (100 kJ), which seems to be the source of the error in the provided key and solution.
Context Accuracy: The question presents a standard ecological food chain and uses the 10% rule of energy transfer, which is a well-established and accurate concept for this context.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning starts correctly by calculating the energy at each trophic level (Grasses 10k, Grasshoppers 1k, Snakes 100, Hawks 10). However, its final sentence, 'Hawks will receive approximately 100 kJ', directly contradicts its own correct calculation. This is a major logical error.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's answer is 100 kJ. The correct calculation shows that the energy transferred to the hawk level is 10 kJ. The generator's answer is incorrect, likely because it was trying to match the incorrect key (C).","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
Write EXACTLY 1 high-quality multiple-choice question (MCQ) and INCLUDE a brief solution (3–6 lines, plain text).
SP (Standard Prompting):
• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

Quality Constraints:
• Clarity: standard terms; no ambiguous processes/structures; enough data for a single best answer.
• Difficulty target: medium (1–2 simple inferences/ratios).
• Distractor effectiveness: three plausible misconceptions.
• Consistency check: verify genotype–phenotype or energy–matter relations before finalizing the key.

STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT (SINGLE ITEM):
- Return ONLY a JSON array containing EXACTLY 1 object.
