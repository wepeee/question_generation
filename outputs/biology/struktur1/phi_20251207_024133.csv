Therefore, to find these frequencies when p represents the frequency of A: ( p^2 ) will give us AA individuals; 2pq gives heterozygotes because there are two ways this can happen - one parent contributes an A and another a or vice versa. q is simply equal to (1-p) since it's just allele frequencies that add up to 100%.

Mitosis duplicates cells and does not contribute to diversity as it produces identical daughter cells.","The question asks for the process that ensures genetic variation in sexually reproducing organisms. 
1. Meiosis is the process of gamete formation which involves two key events that create variation: crossing over (exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes) and independent assortment (random alignment of chromosome pairs). This creates genetically unique gametes.
2. Mitosis is cell division for growth and repair, producing genetically identical daughter cells.
3. Fertilization combines genetic material from two parents, which contributes to offspring variation, but the variation within the gametes is generated by meiosis.
4. Pollination is the physical transfer of pollen, not a process that generates genetic variation itself.

An organism contributes directly to gene flow.,B. An organism does not contribute genetically due to self-pollination within the population.,C. The presence of a heterozygous individual increases variation for future generations despite being homozygous in this generation.,D. Selfing plants have no impact on allele frequencies since they reproduce sexually.,B,"In the context provided, self-pollinating implies that an organism is pollinating itself rather than another individual or from outside sources. According to Hardy–Weinberg principles in a closed system with no migration and random mating (selfing plants), genetic variation does not change over generations if allele frequencies remain constant, which typically occurs when the population size remains large enough for mutation rates to be negligible.","The question's premise is contradictory. A population of exclusively self-pollinating plants cannot be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for genotype frequencies, as selfing is a form of non-random mating that drastically reduces heterozygosity each generation. However, allele frequencies can remain constant. We must evaluate the options based on this corrected understanding.
- A is incorrect; the scenario specifies no external pollination, hence no gene flow.
- C is nonsensical; an individual cannot be both heterozygous and homozygous.
- D is a correct statement; non-random mating (like selfing) alters genotype frequencies but not allele frequencies. 
- B is poorly worded but attempts to describe the effect of selfing at the individual level.

Self-fertilization (Option C) is the reproductive mode, but it inherently leads to increased homozygosity and a reduction in genetic variation over time. Genetic recombination during meiosis (Option D) is the fundamental cellular mechanism that shuffles existing alleles into new combinations in every generation, thereby actively maintaining variation. While mutation introduces new alleles, recombination is what maintains variation by creating new genotypes from the existing allele pool. Therefore, D is the most accurate answer for the mechanism.

Self-pollination itself and genetic drift both lead to a reduction in genetic diversity. Mutation is the ultimate source of new genetic variation, but it is a slow process. Gene flow, which occurs via cross-pollination (even if rare in a predominantly self-pollinating species), is a powerful mechanism for reintroducing alleles and counteracting the loss of diversity caused by genetic drift.

Since there are no other evolutionary forces acting upon this isolated plant group and assuming that all offspring survive to reproduce (i.e., inbreeding depression does not occur), we would expect by Hardy–Weinberg principles for a large population size, random mating within the same species over many generations with no mutation or selection pressure, allele frequencies will remain constant. Therefore, both A and B are correct as they reflect this principle.","The core concept is the effect of self-pollination, a form of extreme inbreeding. In each generation of selfing, the frequency of heterozygotes (Gg) is halved. These heterozygotes are converted into homozygotes (1/4 GG, 1/4 gg). This process does not change the overall allele frequencies of G and g in the population, but it drastically changes the genotype frequencies. Over several generations, the population will consist almost entirely of homozygotes (GG and gg), with very few heterozygotes. This loss of heterozygosity represents a decrease in genetic diversity.

1. Self-pollination is a natural reproductive method, so A is false.

3. Cross-pollination with other species is hybridization, not a standard way to maintain diversity within a species, so D is false.
4. Self-pollination is a form of non-random mating. While this changes genotype frequencies (increasing homozygosity), it does not, by itself, alter allele frequencies.

biology,phi,struktur1,47,5320,What is a key characteristic of an organism that reproduces through self-pollination?,A: It requires cross-pollination.,B: Its offspring are genetically diverse.,C: It can reproduce without pollinators.,D: It always produces flowers with recessive traits.,C,"Self-pollinating organisms have the ability to fertilize themselves, which means they do not require external agents like insects or wind for transferring pollen. This characteristic allows them to reproduce even in isolated environments where such pollinators may be absent.","Self-pollination is the process where pollen from a flower's anther is transferred to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. This mechanism does not require an external agent like an insect, wind, or another plant. Therefore, a key characteristic is the ability to reproduce without pollinators. Option A is the opposite of self-pollination. Option B is incorrect because self-pollination leads to reduced genetic diversity.

The phenotypes corresponding to these genotypes are:

Context Accuracy: The genetic principles (Mendelian inheritance, dominance) are correct. However, the description of the species in the preamble is biologically inaccurate.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is self-contradictory. It correctly states that a heterozygous cross yields a 3:1 phenotypic ratio but then incorrectly concludes that option B (a 1:1 ratio) is the correct answer.

Pollinators are not involved as it's a self-pollinating species.","The question is contradictory, stating the plant is self-pollinating but providing a cross between two different genotypes (WwPp x WWpp). Assuming the cross is the intended problem, let's analyze it. Let 'w' be the allele for white flowers (recessive, so ww = white) and 'P' be the allele for green petals (dominant, so P_ = green). 
The cross Ww x WW yields 100% W_ offspring (dominant, non-white phenotype).
The cross Pp x pp yields 50% Pp (green) and 50% pp (non-green) offspring.

Context Accuracy: The genetic scenario is nonsensical. The description of traits ('white flowers' vs 'green petals') is ambiguous, and the cross provided does not lead to the outcome suggested by the key.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is completely invalid. It ignores the cross given in the question (WwPp x WWpp) and instead analyzes a self-cross (WwPp x WwPp). It also incorrectly reassigns the function of the 'W' gene and invokes an unsupported 9:7 epistatic ratio. The reasoning is entirely disconnected from the problem statement.

If we assume that having green petals (G) is dominant over white petals (w), then all GG or WW homozygous plants will produce either all green-petaled offspring if they are GG, or only white-petaled flowers if ww.","The question states that all plants in a self-pollinating population are homozygous for the alleles for green and white petals. This implies the population consists of some plants with genotype GG (green) and some with genotype ww (white). Under self-pollination, GG plants will only produce GG offspring, and ww plants will only produce ww offspring. Therefore, the proportions of GG and ww plants will not change, and consequently, the frequencies of the G and w alleles in the population will remain constant.

Context Accuracy: The biological scenario of petal color inheritance in a self-pollinating plant is realistic and conceptually sound.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is biologically and genetically correct. It accurately describes that self-pollination of homozygous individuals produces offspring with the same homozygous genotype.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's reasoning is sound, but it directly contradicts the provided key (A).
