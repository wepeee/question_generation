3. Incomplete dominance/Codominance: An intermediate or combined phenotype is observed.
Because the nature of the mutation isn't specified, the most accurate answer is that one cannot predict the effect without more information (Option D). However, in introductory genetics, the 'expected' or default case is often simple Mendelian inheritance where mutations are recessive. In that context, the normal gene masks the mutated one (Option C), which is the provided key.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,26302,3.5,5,Correct,1,"Clarity: The question is ambiguous because it omits crucial information about the nature of the mutation (e.g., dominant, recessive, loss-of-function). This makes option D highly plausible, even though C is the intended answer in a simplified context.
Context Accuracy: The question is based on a fundamental and accurate scenario in diploid genetics. The concepts of genes, mutations, and phenotypes are used correctly.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is severely flawed. It correctly identifies the concept of masking but incorrectly labels it as 'incomplete penetrance'. The correct term is 'dominance'. This is a significant conceptual error.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator chose C, which matches the provided key. While the question is ambiguous, C represents the common Mendelian concept of a dominant wild-type allele masking a recessive mutation, which is likely the intended answer.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

The frequencies of genotypes are p^2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q^2 (homozygous recessive). The total frequency of homozygous individuals is p^2 + q^2. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is 2pq. The ratio of heterozygous to homozygous individuals is therefore 2pq : (p^2 + q^2). This ratio is not constant and depends on the values of p and q.

- A is false: Due to incomplete penetrance, not all homozygous recessive individuals will have the characteristic.
- B is true: Heterozygotes ('Aa') will express the dominant trait, so the recessive characteristic will be absent. This is the definition of recessivity.
- C is true: For a recessive trait to be expressed, the individual must be homozygous recessive. Therefore, anyone who *does* have the characteristic must have the 'aa' genotype.
- D is false: The premise states the characteristic is associated with the allele.

Both B and C are correct statements. However, C is a statement about all individuals who *have* the characteristic, which is the subject of the question.

- A is false: A rare allele, especially a recessive one, will be expressed in very few individuals (only homozygous recessives), so its impact on the population's phenotype is not significant.
- B is false: Because the allele is rare, most individuals in the population do not carry it. Therefore, it is unlikely that a randomly selected offspring will inherit it.
- C is false: Dominance is an intrinsic property of an allele's expression in a heterozygote; it does not change based on allele frequency.

biology,llama,struktur1,49,6867,"In a cell, what is the primary function of the intermediate filaments?",To provide structural support and mechanical strength,To facilitate protein synthesis,To regulate gene expression,To transport molecules across the cell membrane,A,"Intermediate filaments are a type of cytoskeletal element that provides mechanical strength and structural support to cells. They play a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, resisting external forces, and facilitating cellular processes.","The question asks for the primary function of intermediate filaments. These are one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton. Reviewing the functions of the cytoskeletal elements:
- Microtubules are involved in transport, cell division, and motility (cilia/flagella).
- Microfilaments (actin) are involved in cell shape, muscle contraction, and motility.
- Intermediate filaments are known for their high tensile strength and stability. Their primary role is to bear tension, provide mechanical strength, and anchor organelles, thus maintaining the cell's structural integrity.
Option A correctly describes this function. The other options are incorrect: protein synthesis is done by ribosomes (B), gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (C), and membrane transport is done by channel/carrier proteins (D).",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,21593,5,5,Correct,5,"Clarity: The question is clear, concise, and uses standard biological terminology.

It is not directly involved in protein synthesis or meiosis regulation.","The question asks for the primary function of a centriole in a eukaryotic cell.
1. Protein synthesis is performed by ribosomes.
2. Storing genetic material is the function of the nucleus.
3. While centrioles are involved in cell division (mitosis and meiosis), their role is not regulation but rather the physical organization of the spindle apparatus.
4. Centrioles are the core components of the centrosome, which acts as the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells. They are essential for forming the mitotic spindle, cilia, and flagella, all of which are microtubule-based structures. Therefore, their primary function is to organize microtubules.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,19208,5,5,Correct,5,"Clarity: The question is clear, concise, and uses standard biological terminology.

Context Accuracy: The question and all options refer to accurate concepts in eukaryotic cell biology. The premise is factually correct.
Quality of Working: The generator's explanation is excellent. It correctly identifies the primary function, provides key examples of microtubule structures (cilia, flagella, spindle fibers), and accurately dismisses other cellular functions.
