- A is false. The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is q^2. The square root of the dominant phenotype frequency (sqrt(p^2 + 2pq)) has no direct simple relationship to q^2.
- B is false. A cross between two heterozygotes (Bb x Bb) has a 25% chance of producing homozygous recessive (bb, blue) offspring.
- C describes a logically impossible scenario. If there are no homozygous recessive individuals, then q^2 = 0, which means q = 0 and p = 1. In this case, the entire population would be homozygous dominant (p^2 = 1), and 100% would show the dominant phenotype, not 64%.
- D is a true statement. Using the frequency of the recessive phenotype (q^2), one can find q, then p (since p=1-q), and finally calculate the heterozygote frequency (2pq). The equation is central to this process.

biology,phi,struktur2,10,31812,"In a population of flowering plants where pink color is dominant over white but recessive to purple, and no mutation occurs, what would be expected according to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium when observing that all offspring are either pink or purple?",Dominance variance affects the outcome.,Recessiveness prevents expression of color.,Both A and B.,There is no influence on phenotype frequency.,A,"Since all offspring are either pink or purple, this indicates that there's complete dominance wherein the presence of one allele (pink) masks another. However, since we don't see white in any plants and only observe two phenotypes, it suggests an equilibrium situation under Hardy-Weinberg principles.","The problem describes a three-allele system for flower color: Purple (P) > Pink (p) > White (w). The observation that all offspring are either pink or purple means the white phenotype (genotype ww) is absent. For this to happen, the frequency of the 'w' allele must be zero. The system therefore simplifies to a two-allele system with P (dominant) and p (recessive). The question asks for an expected outcome. The dominance of P over p means the heterozygote (Pp) has the same phenotype as the dominant homozygote (PP). This non-additive gene action is the source of what is called 'dominance variance' in quantitative genetics. This variance component directly affects the phenotypic distribution (the 'outcome'). Therefore, option A is the most technically correct statement.",gemini:gemini-2.5-pro,31575,2,3,Correct,0.5,"Clarity: The question is poorly formulated. It conflates Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (a principle about allele frequency stability) with dominance variance (a concept from quantitative genetics), which is confusing. The options are abstract and not typical for an HWE problem.

Context Accuracy: The biological premise of a multiple-allele system with a dominance hierarchy is realistic. However, the question's structure, forcing a choice about variance components in an HWE context, is conceptually awkward and not a standard way to test these principles.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is extremely poor. It incorrectly states that pink masks another allele, makes a fallacious link between the observation and the state of equilibrium, and completely fails to mention or explain 'dominance variance', which is the central concept in the correct answer.

This process increases homozygosity over generations. The standard scientific term for a population of organisms that is homozygous for one or more traits and thus breeds true for those traits is a 'pure line'. While such a population would be a 'genetically uniform group', 'pure line' is the specific, technical term for the outcome of this exact genetic procedure.

It states that self-pollination of a population results in 'all members having identical genetic information'. This is only true if the starting population consists of a single homozygous individual. Generally, this process leads to a mixture of different homozygous lines, not a single genetically identical population.
Context Accuracy: The context of Mendelian inheritance and self-pollination is correct. However, the described outcome is an oversimplification of the actual genetic result (Hardy-Weinberg principle for selfing), which reduces the accuracy.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is poor.

This occurs because each parent can pass on either allele (T or t) with equal probability, leading to the predicted genetic ratios when these are combined in offspring.","This question describes a classic Mendelian monohybrid cross. The parents are heterozygous (Tt). A Punnett square for a Tt x Tt cross yields offspring with genotypes in a 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt ratio. Since the tall allele (T) is dominant, both TT and Tt genotypes result in a tall phenotype. The tt genotype results in a short phenotype.

Context Accuracy: The premise is biologically confusing. A population composed solely of phenotypically short (dwarf) pea plants would be entirely homozygous recessive (tt) and could not have the tall allele (T) ""at play"" in its gene pool. The question misrepresents a basic genetic scenario.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is critically flawed. It incorrectly states that the expected *phenotypic* ratio is 1:2:1, which is a *genotypic* ratio.

Option B states that Punnett squares can predict genotype ratios based on Mendelian inheritance. This is a fundamental and universally applicable principle for analyzing such crosses, regardless of the specific dominance pattern (complete, incomplete, etc.).
Option A is incorrect; crossing two parents with the same trait (incomplete flowers) is unlikely to produce 100% of offspring with a different trait (complete flowers).
Option C is nonsensically worded, introducing new terms (""broken flower"") and making an ambiguous probabilistic claim that cannot be verified without more information.

Option C is extremely confusing, introducing new, undefined terms like ""broken flower trait"".

Context Accuracy: The context is weak. While plant genetics is real, the terminology is non-standard and misleading. ""Broken flower"" historically refers to a viral effect in tulips, which is not a Mendelian trait, making its inclusion here inaccurate and confusing.

Quality of Working: The generator correctly identifies B. The reasoning for B is sound. However, the reasoning for dismissing A and C is based on the unstated assumption of incomplete dominance.

This means there's a 25% chance of getting pp offspring, which would display no color due to both alleles being recessive 'not colored'. There's also an equal probability (also 25%) that the plants will produce Pp or PP genotypes resulting in purple flowers. However, since incomplete dominance is at play and not simple dominant-recessive inheritance, there will be a noticeable blend of red and white, leading to pink phenotype for heterozygous (Pp) offspring.","The question asks to evaluate the outcome of a Pp x Pp cross with incomplete dominance. The cross yields genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio: 1 PP, 2 Pp, and 1 pp.
According to the question's premises:
- PP phenotype is red ('P' allele is red).
- Pp phenotype is purple (stated in the stem).
- pp phenotype is not colored ('p' allele is not colored).
Therefore, the offspring will be 25% red, 50% purple, and 25% not colored.

It is not a multiple-choice question as it only provides one option. The premise is also confusing, stating red + no color results in purple for incomplete dominance, which is biologically unusual (pink would be expected).

Context Accuracy: The genetic context is inaccurate. The question uses ""peapod plants"" for a flower trait. Furthermore, purple flower color in pea plants is a classic example of complete dominance, not the artificial incomplete dominance scenario described.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is very poor. It correctly states the 1:2:1 genotype ratio but then misstates probabilities, contradicts the question's premise (calling the heterozygote pink when the question defines it as purple), and even contradicts itself. It fails to clearly evaluate the provided option.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator does not give an explicit answer. However, its flawed explanation correctly implies that there will be a mix of phenotypes, which contradicts the provided (and incorrect) key.

In this case, Aa and aa are both homozygous states where 'A' is dominant and 'aa' recessive; thus we have two alleles for simplicity (using H as a placeholder). The expected frequencies according to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium would be p^2 = frequency of AA: 0.367, q^2 = frequency of aa: 0.167 and since Aa is heterozygous the remaining proportion will have genotype 'Aa': Heterozygous frequency (2pq) which turns out to be around 0.4 in this case as two alleles are present, so p = sqrt(3/5), q=sqrt(1/5).

Furthermore, none of the options represent a population in HWE. For a population to be in HWE with two alleles present, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) must be greater than zero.

It uses incorrect terminology (e.g., 'recessive allele (aa)' confuses an allele with a genotype) and is missing the necessary initial conditions (genotype or allele frequencies) to solve the problem.

Context Accuracy: The context is inaccurate because the premise (maintaining HWE) is fundamentally contradicted by the provided options. Specifically, options B and C, with 0% heterozygotes, cannot represent a population in HWE.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is nonsensical.

• Write 1 concise concept/application MCQ from: basic genetics (incl. Hardy–Weinberg), cell/tissue structure–function, or short ecology.
• Use standard terminology; if arithmetic appears (e.g., allele frequency), keep numbers small and round to 2 decimals.
• Distractors reflect common misconceptions (dominance ≠ frequency, misreading ratios/diagrams, DNA→RNA→Protein confusion).

CoT (few-shot analogue; hidden 1–2 steps):
• Identify concept/ratio/mini-table relations INTERNALLY; do NOT show steps.

Style example (Hardy–Weinberg): compute 2pq internally → choose option.
• Create a NEW item of the same family (small table/genotype ratio/energy flow).
• Distractors must be plausible and map to real misconceptions.

biology,phi,struktur2,50,11235,"In Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, if allele A has a frequency of 0.7 in a population that is infinitely large, which genotype will most likely have an increased representation?",AA (Homozygous dominant),Aa (Heterozygous),aa (Homozygous recessive),No increase in any specific genotype,C,"In Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of homozysotes and heterozygous individuals can be predicted. Given that allele A has a high frequency (0.7), under these conditions, there will not necessarily be an increase in AA or Aa genotypes but rather aa could become more common due to sampling error if p>q.","The question is about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Let p be the frequency of allele A and q be the frequency of allele a.
Given p = 0.7, then q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.
The genotype frequencies are:
- AA (homozygous dominant): p² = (0.7)² = 0.49
- Aa (heterozygous): 2pq = 2 * 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.42
- aa (homozygous recessive): q² = (0.3)² = 0.09
The most frequent genotype is AA. However, the question asks which genotype will have an 'increased representation' in a population already 'in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium'. By definition, equilibrium means genotype frequencies are stable and do not increase. Therefore, the most logical answer is D. The provided key, C, is incorrect as 'aa' is the least frequent genotype.",maia:maia/gemini-2.5-pro,34517,1,1,Incorrect,0,"Clarity: The question is poorly worded and self-contradictory. The premise 'In Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium' implies stable frequencies, while the question asks about an 'increased representation', which implies a change in frequency. This ambiguity makes the question's intent unclear.

Context Accuracy: The question contains a conceptual error by implying that a genotype frequency can increase while a population is in equilibrium. Furthermore, the provided key (C) is factually incorrect; the 'aa' genotype is the least frequent (9%) and has no reason to increase.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely flawed. It incorrectly invokes 'sampling error' (genetic drift) for an 'infinitely large' population, a condition that explicitly excludes drift. It then makes a baseless assertion that 'aa' would become more common, which contradicts established principles of population genetics.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's solution attempts to justify the provided key (C), which is incorrect. The 'aa' genotype is the least frequent, not the one that would increase. The generator's conclusion is wrong because it is based on fallacious reasoning.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
