A single set of chromosomes defines a haploid cell (n).
Meiosis is the process of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells from one diploid cell. This directly matches the description.
Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth. It maintains the ploidy level. It would only produce haploid cells if the parent cell were already haploid.

Let p be the frequency of A and q be the frequency of a. From the ratio, we know (p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1) or (1 + 2(2) + 1 = 5). Since (p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq = 1), and given the ratio, we can deduce that (2pq = 0.4) or (p(2q) = 0.4). Since (p + q = 1), let's solve for p: if (q = 1 - p), then (2p(1-p) = 0.4) leading to (2p - 2p^2 = 0.4), which simplifies to (2p^2 - 2p + 0.4 = 0).
