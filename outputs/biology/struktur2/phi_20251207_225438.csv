Given that allele A has a high frequency (0.7), under these conditions, there will not necessarily be an increase in AA or Aa genotypes but rather aa could become more common due to sampling error if p>q.","The question is about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Let p be the frequency of allele A and q be the frequency of allele a.
Given p = 0.7, then q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.
The genotype frequencies are:
- AA (homozygous dominant): p² = (0.7)² = 0.49
- Aa (heterozygous): 2pq = 2 * 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.42
- aa (homozygous recessive): q² = (0.3)² = 0.09
The most frequent genotype is AA. However, the question asks which genotype will have an 'increased representation' in a population already 'in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium'.

The premise 'In Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium' implies stable frequencies, while the question asks about an 'increased representation', which implies a change in frequency. This ambiguity makes the question's intent unclear.

Context Accuracy: The question contains a conceptual error by implying that a genotype frequency can increase while a population is in equilibrium. Furthermore, the provided key (C) is factually incorrect; the 'aa' genotype is the least frequent (9%) and has no reason to increase.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely flawed. It incorrectly invokes 'sampling error' (genetic drift) for an 'infinitely large' population, a condition that explicitly excludes drift. It then makes a baseless assertion that 'aa' would become more common, which contradicts established principles of population genetics.

Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's solution attempts to justify the provided key (C), which is incorrect. The 'aa' genotype is the least frequent, not the one that would increase. The generator's conclusion is wrong because it is based on fallacious reasoning.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

Option A suggests selection (either artificial by the gardener or natural if yellow-flowered plants are 'fitter'), which is a valid evolutionary mechanism that would alter allele frequencies and thus phenotypic ratios in the observed direction.

However, because 'Tall' is dominant over 'short', both TT and Tt will result in tall offspring. Using the Punnett square method to determine allele combinations we get 1/4 TT (homozygous dominant), which results in a homozygous genotype that appears as tall, 2/4 or 1/2 of being heterozygous with tall appearance. The last half will be tt resulting short phenotype since no 'T' allele is present to mask the 't'. Therefore, we expect a ratio of Tall:Short plants which translates into one part each for homozygous dominant (TT) and heterozygous (Tt), against zero parts with tt. This gives us expected 2 tall offspring out of every three.","The question asks for the phenotypic ratio from a cross of two heterozygous tall plants (Tt x Tt).
Using a Punnett square for this monohybrid cross, the resulting genotypes are 1 TT, 2 Tt, and 1 tt.

If the cross is Pp x Pp, the phenotypic ratio is 3 purple : 1 white. This is not an option.

Context Accuracy: The context is inaccurate. In simple Mendelian genetics for pea plants, a heterozygous (Pp) plant exhibits the dominant purple phenotype. A white-flowered plant must be homozygous recessive (pp). Therefore, a plant cannot be both heterozygous and white-flowered.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely incorrect. It identifies the cross as heterozygous parents (Pp x Pp) but then states the resulting phenotypic ratio is 1:1. The correct ratio for a Pp x Pp cross is 3:1. The generator provides the wrong outcome for the cross it describes.

If the observed phenotypic ratio in a population's offspring aligns with the predictions of the Hardy-Weinberg model, it strongly suggests that the conditions for equilibrium are being met.

""In a population of short pea plants"" is contradictory if both tall and dwarf alleles are ""at play"", as short is the recessive phenotype (tt). It is also vague about what ""the phenotypic ratio expected under Hardy–Weinberg principles"" is, as this ratio depends on allele frequencies.

Context Accuracy: The premise is biologically confusing. A population composed solely of phenotypically short (dwarf) pea plants would be entirely homozygous recessive (tt) and could not have the tall allele (T) ""at play"" in its gene pool. The question misrepresents a basic genetic scenario.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is critically flawed. It incorrectly states that the expected *phenotypic* ratio is 1:2:1, which is a *genotypic* ratio. It then compounds the error by saying it assumes complete dominance, which would make a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio impossible. The logic is self-contradictory, even though it stumbles upon the correct answer.

Solving for q gives us sqrt(q^2) = sqrt(0.40) which equals approximately 0.63 (rounded down). Since p + q = 1, we get that the frequency of allele P is then 1 - q, so it's about 1 - 0.63 = 0.37 or roughly Choice B.","The problem states that the frequency of white flowers (homozygous recessive, pp) is 40%.

Since tall is dominant, all of these exhibit tall phenotypes except tt which shows short. However, because of the large population size and dominance principle in Mendelian inheritance (i.e., only one copy of a recessive allele is needed to show the trait), we approximate that 75% will display the dominant traits while approximately 25% might exhibit the non-dominant phenotype, but this may vary slightly due to chance and sample size.","Let T be the dominant allele for tall stems and t be the recessive allele for short stems.

Context Accuracy: The context is a standard, conceptually sound Mendelian genetics problem. The premise is accurate for simple dominant/recessive inheritance.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is completely flawed. It correctly identifies the parental cross (TT x Tt) but then incorrectly states the resulting genotype ratio is 1:2:1. This ratio is from a Tt x Tt cross. The entire subsequent explanation is based on this fundamental error.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's reasoning leads to the 3/4 tall, 1/4 short ratio (Option D), which is incorrect. The correct answer for a TT x Tt cross is 100% tall (Option A). The provided key (D) is also incorrect.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.

A phenotype is the observable physical trait. For a recessive trait like 'short stems' to be expressed, the organism must be homozygous for the recessive allele. This means its genotype must be 'tt', as it lacks the dominant 'T' allele that would otherwise mask the recessive trait.

It introduces the concept of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, which is irrelevant for solving a problem about a single, specific Mendelian cross (heterozygote x heterozygote). This extraneous information can mislead the student.
Context Accuracy: The basic genetic concepts (dominance, genotype, phenotype) are correct. However, invoking Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a specific, non-random cross is a fundamental conceptual error. H-W describes allele frequencies in a large, randomly mating population, not the outcome of a Punnett square.
Quality of Working: The generator's solution is concise and provides the correct reasoning. It correctly states that the 'tt' genotype results in the short phenotype due to the absence of the dominant allele. The reasoning is sound and directly answers the question.
Final Answer Accuracy: The generator's solution correctly identifies 'tt' as the genotype that produces the short stem phenotype, which corresponds to option C.","SYSTEM: You are a Grade 12 Biology teacher.
