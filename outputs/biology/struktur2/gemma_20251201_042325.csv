Since B (brown) is dominant over b (blue), the phenotypes are:
- BB and Bb individuals are brown.
- bb individuals are blue.
This results in a phenotypic ratio of 3 brown mice to 1 blue mouse, or 3:1.

biology,gemma,struktur2,35,20391,A gardener crosses two grey rabbits. Grey is dominant over grey. The F1 generation consists of 16 grey rabbits and 16 white rabbits.

This corresponds to phenotypic frequencies of 0.25 for red and 0.75 for white.
Under complete dominance, the frequency of the recessive phenotype is equal to the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (q^2).
The question is ambiguous as to which color is recessive. Let's test both possibilities.
Case 1: Red is recessive. Then q^2 = 0.25, so q = 0.5. Since p + q = 1, p = 0.5. The heterozygous frequency is 2pq = 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.50.

biology,gemma,struktur2,66,11971,"A horticulturist is examining a patch of lavender plants. He finds that 160 plants are purple and 80 are pink. The pink color is due to a recessive allele. If all lavender plants in the patch are assumed to be diploid, what is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (PP) among the lavender plants?",0.25,0.5,0.75,1,B,"The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (PP) can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Since q^2 represents the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (pp), we can find the frequency of the recessive allele (q) by calculating the square root of the recessive allele frequency. Let 'q' be the frequency of the recessive allele. Then, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q. Therefore the frequency of PP is p^2 = (1-q)^2. We are given that the pink color is due to a recessive allele, which means the frequency of the pink phenotype is q^2. If q^2 = 0.25, then q = 0.5 and p = 0.5. This gives p^2 = 0.25.","First, calculate the total number of plants: 160 purple + 80 pink = 240 plants. The pink color is recessive, so the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (pp) is q^2. 
q^2 = (Number of pink plants) / (Total plants) = 80 / 240 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333.
Next, find the frequency of the recessive allele (q) by taking the square root of q^2.
q = sqrt(1/3) ≈ 0.577.
The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q.
p = 1 - sqrt(1/3) ≈ 1 - 0.577 = 0.423.
The question asks for the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (PP), which is p^2.
p^2 = (1 - sqrt(1/3))^2 ≈ (0.423)^2 ≈ 0.179.

The F1 generation is entirely purple, implying they are heterozygous (Pp), resulting from a cross between homozygous dominant (PP) and homozygous recessive (pp) parents. To get the F2 generation, the F1 generation is self-crossed (Pp x Pp). A Punnett square for this cross yields genotypes in a 1 PP : 2 Pp : 1 pp ratio.

Stating that a cross of two ""lavender"" petunias results in all ""purple"" offspring is confusing and contradicts the simple dominance model the question asks the solver to assume.
Context Accuracy: The premise is genetically inaccurate under the stated conditions. A cross between two identical parents (lavender) cannot produce a uniform but different phenotype (all purple) in the F1 generation in a simple dominance scenario.
Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is critically flawed. It correctly identifies the F1 as heterozygous but then incorrectly states the F2 generation follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is for a dihybrid cross, not a monohybrid cross. This makes the explanation fundamentally incorrect and internally inconsistent.
Final Answer Accuracy: The correct answer is 3:1. The generator's flawed reasoning accidentally arrives at the correct proportions (3/4 and 1/4), which correspond to the correct 3:1 ratio.

Context Accuracy: The biological context of flower color inheritance in roses and the use of F1/F2 generations are accurate and standard for genetics problems. The 1:1 ratio from the initial cross is a valid outcome for a test cross.

Quality of Working: The generator's reasoning is extremely poor and unscientific. The statement ""as each parent contributes an equal allele for flower color"" is not a valid genetic principle and does not explain the resulting ratio.
